# Lean-BCH — Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff in Lean 4

## Status: **All BCH files sorry-free (2026-04-24, updated session 9).** Basic, Palindromic, LogSeries: see prior status. Branch `trotter-5factor-palindromic`: ChildsBasis (axiom-1 infrastructure + BCHPrefactors struct), Suzuki5Quintic (βᵢ(p) polynomials + R₅ Childs-basis def + unit-coefficient norm bound + headline τ⁵-identification theorem + bridge corollary + **tight bridge at Suzuki p, fully proved**), **SymmetricQuintic (τ⁵ coefficient infrastructure + B1.c quintic Taylor bridge via Tier-2 axiom)**, **Palindromic B1.d (per-block quintic bound derived from B1.c)**. Infrastructure is ready for Lean-Trotter's axioms 1 AND 2:

- Axiom 1 (`bch_w4Deriv_quintic_level2`): wired up via `suzuki5_log_product_quintic_of_IsSuzukiCubic`; derived from the single remaining private axiom `suzuki5_R5_identification_axiom`.
- Axiom 2 (`bch_w4Deriv_level3_tight`): **P2 axiom discharged session 8.** Bridge theorem `suzuki5_log_product_quintic_tight_at_suzukiP` derived solely from the headline theorem + `norm_suzuki5_R5_at_suzukiP_le_bchTightPrefactors_boundSum` (now a fully-proved theorem, not an axiom).

Session 9 closed **B1.c** (quintic Taylor bridge for 3-factor symmetric BCH, `norm_symmetric_bch_quintic_sub_poly_le`) and **B1.d** (per-block `strangBlock_log` quintic wrapper, `norm_strangBlock_log_sub_quintic_target_le`) via a scoped Tier-2 axiom `symmetric_bch_quintic_sub_poly_axiom` (see "Remaining axioms"). These unblock **B2** (symbolic 5-factor BCH composition onto Childs basis — the primary bottleneck for discharging the P1 axiom).

Repository remains 0-sorry. **Axiom count: 2 scoped `private axiom`s + Lean's 3 standard** (up from 1 by the new B1.c Tier-2 fallback). See "Remaining axioms" section below.

Earlier state: Basic: H1, H2, M1, quintic BCH, symmetric quartic identity, alt-form, decomposition equality, all six triangle-inequality bounds (R₁, R₂, T3, T4, and the T5/T6 ring-identity bounds with the `(96)⁻¹·[b,DC_a]` cancellation), and the downstream `norm_symmetric_bch_cubic_sub_smul_le` all complete. Palindromic: M1–M4b closed, telescoping bound, exp-Lipschitz `norm_exp_add_sub_exp_le`, **M6 Trotter h4 theorem** `norm_s4Func_sub_exp_le_of_IsSuzukiCubic` — `‖s4Func(t/n, n) - exp(t•(A+B))‖ = O(|t|⁵·s⁵/n⁴)` under IsSuzukiCubic — and **M4b RHS quintic corollary** `suzuki5_bch_M4b_RHS_le_t5_of_IsSuzukiCubic` (∃ δ, K, ∀ τ < δ, RHS ≤ K·‖τ‖⁵), which is the payoff lemma for downstream Lean-Trotter.

## Goal

Formalize the BCH formula and its truncated bounds in a general complete normed algebra,
with applications to product formula error analysis (Trotter, Strang, Suzuki).

## Constraints

- **Lean:** 4.29.0-rc8 (via `lean-toolchain`)
- **Mathlib:** pinned in `lake-manifest.json`
- **Typeclass setup:** `[NormedRing 𝔸] [NormedAlgebra 𝕂 𝔸] [NormOneClass 𝔸] [CompleteSpace 𝔸]`
- `include 𝕂 in` needed before theorems where `𝕂` appears in proofs but not in the type signature

## Relation to Lean-Trotter

The [Lean-Trotter](https://github.com/Jue-Xu/Lean-Trotter) project proves the first-order
Lie–Trotter formula `(exp(A/n)exp(B/n))^n → exp(A+B)` and second-order Strang splitting
using direct exp bounds. This BCH project provides:

- **H1** (`norm_bch_sub_add_sub_bracket_le`): Commutator extraction — identifies `[A,B]/2`
  as the leading BCH correction, with cubic remainder. Needed for Suzuki S₄.
- **H2** (`norm_symmetric_bch_sub_add_le`): Symmetric BCH — shows the `[A/2,B]` commutator
  cancels in `bch(bch(A/2,B),A/2)`, giving cubic error. This is the BCH-based proof that
  Strang splitting is second-order.

The Lean-Trotter `StrangSplitting.lean` proves second-order convergence via direct algebraic
splitting. The BCH approach here gives a cleaner route to higher-order (S₄) analysis.

## Key Techniques

### Non-commutative scalar issue
`(2:𝕂)⁻¹ • x` (scalar smul) doesn't interact with `noncomm_ring` or `abel`.
**Solution:** Multiply both sides by `(2:𝕂)`, clear via `smul_smul` + `inv_mul_cancel₀` +
`one_smul`, then use `noncomm_ring` on the scalar-free identity.

### Commutator cancellation in H2
Ring identity: `(z*a' - a'*z) + (a'*b - b*a') = (z-a'-b)*a' - a'*(z-a'-b)`.
Proved by `noncomm_ring`. Since `‖z-a'-b‖ = O(s²)`, the RHS is `O(s³)`.

### Taylor bounds for `nlinarith`
Feed `nlinarith` pre-computed bounds: `exp(s) ≤ 1+s+s²` (from `Real.norm_exp_sub_one_sub_id_le`),
`s⁴ ≤ s³` (for `s < 1`), `α³+β³ ≤ s³` (convexity), `αβ ≤ s²/4` (AM-GM).

### Algebraic identities: quartic_identity pattern
The `quartic_identity` (line ~1614) is a ring identity in abstract `ea, eb, a, b` that expresses
`½W + ⅓z³ - C₃` as a sum of terms each bounded by O(s⁴). Proved by:
1. Prove `hpure` sub-identity (pure a,b) by multiplying by 12 + `noncomm_ring`
2. Prove full identity by multiplying by 24 + `simp [smul_smul, ...]` + `noncomm_ring`

### Critical lesson: non-commutative degree-4 cancellation
**The degree-4 cancellation in the quintic BCH is NOT an exact ring identity** (neither in
`a,b` nor in `ea,eb,a,b`). The non-commutative discrepancy `zPz ≠ z²P` means individual
degree-4 terms are `O(s⁴)`, not zero. However, their SUM is `O(s⁵)` due to the BCH structure.

**Consequence:** The quintic proof CANNOT follow the quartic pattern (ring identity → term-by-term
bounds). Instead, it must use a **norm-based grouping** where groups of degree-4 terms are
bounded collectively by `O(s⁵)` using commutator estimates and the specific structure of the
exp/log expansion.

**Key estimates for the degree-4 grouping:**
- `‖[P,z]‖ = ‖[exp(a)exp(b), a+b]‖ ≤ exp(s)·αβs ≈ s³` (commutator of product with sum)
- `‖z[P,z]‖ ≤ s⁴` (one order below the quartic bound)
- The FULL combination of degree-4 corrections is `O(s⁵)` because the BCH Z₅ term provides
  the exact cancellation pattern.

## Remaining Sorry's

None across all five BCH files (verified 2026-04-24). The repository is fully
sorry-free.

## Remaining axioms

Beyond Lean's standard three (`propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`),
the following `private axiom`s are introduced on branch
`trotter-5factor-palindromic`:

### Axiom 1: `BCH.suzuki5_R5_identification_axiom`

(in `BCH/Suzuki5Quintic.lean`, scope-`private`) — the symbolic 5-factor
BCH τ⁵-identification statement. Asserts that under `IsSuzukiCubic p`,
`∃ δ > 0, ∃ K ≥ 0, ∀ τ ∈ [−δ, δ],
 ‖suzuki5_bch ℝ A B p τ − τ•(A+B) − τ⁵ • suzuki5_R5 A B p‖ ≤ K·‖τ‖⁶`.

The public theorems `BCH.norm_suzuki5_bch_sub_smul_sub_R5_le` and
`BCH.suzuki5_log_product_quintic_of_IsSuzukiCubic` depend on this axiom.
Their signatures match Lean-Trotter's `bch_w4Deriv_quintic_level2`.
Lean-Trotter at rev `5a2c03e` has already converted axiom 1 to a theorem
using these.

Removing the axiom requires three tiers of symbolic Lean work (see
header docstring of `BCH/Suzuki5Quintic.lean`):

- **Tier 1** (~1–2 days): quintic Taylor expansion of each
  `strangBlock_log A B c τ`, extending `Basic.lean`'s 2-factor
  `norm_symmetric_bch_cubic_sub_smul_le` to the 3-factor symmetric
  strangBlock case.
- **Tier 2** (~weeks, the hardest): symbolic triple-BCH composition,
  substituting Tier 1 into `suzuki5_bch = bch(bch(2X, Y), 2X)`, expanding
  via `norm_bch_sub_add_sub_bracket_le` (H1), and Gauss-Jordan
  projecting onto the Childs 4-fold commutator basis. LCM of
  denominators ≈ 144000; use scalar-clearing `noncomm_ring`.
- **Tier 3** (~1 day): triangle-inequality residual bounding using the
  existing `suzuki5_bch_M4b_RHS_le_t5_of_IsSuzukiCubic` and the Tier 1/2
  residuals.

The user's phase-1 task prompt explicitly sanctioned the Tier-2 axiom
fallback; removing the axiom is earmarked for follow-up sessions.

### Axiom 2 (NEW session 9): `BCH.symmetric_bch_quintic_sub_poly_axiom`

(in `BCH/SymmetricQuintic.lean`, scope-`private`) — the quintic Taylor
bridge for the 3-factor symmetric BCH. Asserts that for `‖a‖+‖b‖ < 1/4`,

```
‖symmetric_bch_cubic 𝕂 a b − symmetric_bch_cubic_poly 𝕂 a b
    − symmetric_bch_quintic_poly 𝕂 a b‖ ≤ 10⁹ · (‖a‖+‖b‖)⁷
```

extending `Basic.lean`'s cubic-version `norm_symmetric_bch_cubic_sub_poly_le`
by one degree. CAS at `Lean-Trotter/scripts/verify_strangblock_degree7.py`
confirms degrees 2, 4, 6 vanish identically (palindromic symmetry) and
the degree-7 residual has 126 non-zero `{a,b}`-words, so the statement is
structurally sound — only the explicit `hdecomp` proof is deferred.

The public theorems
`BCH.norm_symmetric_bch_quintic_sub_poly_le` (the B1.c bridge) and
`BCH.norm_strangBlock_log_sub_quintic_target_le` (the B1.d per-block wrapper
in `Palindromic.lean`) depend on this axiom. Downstream: B2 (symbolic
5-factor BCH composition on the Childs basis) and Lean-Trotter's discharge
of the P1 axiom chain pin against B1.d.

Removing the axiom requires three tiers of Lean work (per the session
prompt at `claude/lean-bch-B1c-session-prompt.md`):

- **Tier 1** (~1–2 days): add `bch_quintic_term a b` and
  `norm_bch_sextic_remainder_le` in `Basic.lean` (analogs of the existing
  `bch_quartic_term` and `norm_bch_quintic_remainder_le`), identifying the
  degree-5 coefficient of `bch(a,b)` and giving an `O(s⁶/(2−exp(s)))`
  tail bound. The sextic-remainder proof alone is ~500 lines, paralleling
  the existing ~800-line quintic-remainder proof at line 2326 of
  `Basic.lean`.

- **Tier 2** (~1 week, the hardest): extend the 6-term algebraic
  decomposition in the cubic template `norm_symmetric_bch_cubic_sub_poly_le`
  (line ~3798 of `Basic.lean`) to the 8–10-term decomposition of the
  quintic version. Each additional term captures a degree-5 correction
  bounded by commutator algebra + the new sextic remainder. The CAS
  pipeline at `Lean-Trotter/scripts/compute_bch_prefactors.py` (extended
  to degree 7) discovers the decomposition mechanically. Expect ~400
  lines of `noncomm_ring` after scalar clearing for `hdecomp`.

- **Tier 3** (~1 day): triangle-inequality assembly of the 8–10 per-term
  `O(s⁷)` bounds — analogous to the cubic template's `5×10⁶ + 5000 +
  1000 + 1 + 500 + 2 = 5,006,503` constant chain.

Introduced `private` so only the public theorems appear in the API.

### Rigorously proved (no axioms) — Axiom 2 infrastructure (sessions 7–8)

All of the following depend only on Lean's 3 standard axioms:

- `BCH.suzukiP` — the canonical real Suzuki root `1/(4 − 4^(1/3))`.
- `BCH.IsSuzukiCubic_suzukiP` — `IsSuzukiCubic suzukiP`, from the
  algebraic identity `4p³ + (1 − 4p)³ = (4 − r³)/(4 − r)³` at
  `r = 4^(1/3)` where `r³ = 4`.
- `BCH.rpow_one_third_cube`, `BCH.one_lt_rpow_one_third`,
  `BCH.rpow_one_third_lt_four`, `BCH.four_sub_rpow_pos` — basic
  inequalities for `4^(1/3)`.
- `BCH.suzukiP_mem_rational_interval` — **tight bound**
  `41449/100000 < suzukiP < 41450/100000` (slack ~8·10⁻⁶ lower and
  ~0.9·10⁻⁶ upper), proved via `nlinarith` on the expanded Suzuki cubic
  `−60p³ + 48p² − 12p + 1 = 0` with polynomial hints at the interval
  endpoints. Tighter than the earlier `414/1000 < … < 415/1000`;
  necessary for the γᵢ bounds below to close.
- `BCH.abs_suzuki5_βᵢ_at_suzukiP_le_γᵢ` (i = 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8) —
  six per-i numerical bounds `|βᵢ(suzukiP)| ≤ γᵢ`, each via `nlinarith`
  on the interval + `sq_nonneg` hints. `i = 3, 7` are trivially 0.
- `BCH.norm_suzuki5_R5_at_suzukiP_le_bchTightPrefactors_boundSum` —
  **P2 bound is now a theorem** (was axiom in session 7). Follows from
  the six per-i lemmas + triangle inequality via a 7-step `norm_add_le`
  chain + eight per-term `norm_smul_le` applications.
- `BCH.BCHPrefactors` struct + `bchTightPrefactors` instance (with γ₂
  = 663/10⁶ and γ₆ = 1128/10⁶ as proper ceilings) + `BCHPrefactors.boundSum`
  + positivity + `bchTightPrefactors_boundSum_le_bchFourFoldSum`.
- `BCH.suzuki5_log_product_quintic_tight_at_suzukiP` — bridge theorem
  matching Lean-Trotter's `bch_w4Deriv_level3_tight`. `#print axioms`
  shows only `{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound,
  BCH.suzuki5_R5_identification_axiom}` (the P1 axiom only — the P2
  axiom is gone).

### Coordinated γ fix (landed Lean-Trotter rev `63af0e9`)

Lean-Trotter's `bchTightPrefactors` used truncations of
`|βᵢ(suzukiP)|` to 6 decimals, making γ₂, γ₆ slightly *below* the true
values (~0.3×10⁻⁶). Fixed in Lean-Trotter at rev `63af0e9` to use
ceilings (`γ₂ := 663/10⁶`, `γ₆ := 1128/10⁶`). Lean-BCH matches exactly.

### Prior closures

The M4b RHS quintic corollary `suzuki5_bch_M4b_RHS_le_t5_of_IsSuzukiCubic`
(commit `9ffaab4`) proves that `∃ δ > 0, ∃ K ≥ 0, ∀ τ < δ,
suzuki5_bch_M4b_RHS A B p τ ≤ K·‖τ‖⁵`. Strategy: choose
`δ = 1/(5·pn·qn·s)` with `pn = ‖p‖+1`, `qn = ‖1-4p‖+1`, `s = ‖A‖+‖B‖+1`;
bound each of the four unfolded terms separately via `pow_le_pow_left₀`,
the helper `norm_strangBlock_log_linear` (η + η³ + 10⁷·η⁵ ≤ 40002·η for
η ≤ 1/4), and `gcongr`. Body extracted to private
`suzuki5_bch_M4b_RHS_le_t5_aux` to keep kernel `whnf` within heartbeat
budget (16M).

### Earlier closures (2026-04-23):

The final two Basic.lean triangle-inequality terms were closed on 2026-04-23:

- **Term 6** (`C₄(z,a') - C₄(a'+b,a')` ≤ 2·s⁵): proved via the ring identity
  `DC_z - DC_p = S6` (noncomm_ring after z = (a'+b)+W) where S6 is an explicit
  three-commutator sum, each containing at least one `W`. Norm bounds use
  `‖W‖ ≤ 48·s²/11` and `‖a'+b‖ ≤ 3s/2`.
- **Term 5** (`C₃(z,a') - C₃(a'+b,a') + (96)⁻¹·[b,DC_a]` ≤ 500·s⁵): proved by
  splitting into three sub-identities:
  1. `Id1`: `C₃(p+W,a') - C₃(p,a') = (12)⁻¹·(L(W) + Q(W))` (noncomm_ring after
     12-injective scalar clearing);
  2. `Id2` (key cancellation): `(12)⁻¹·L(W₂) + (96)⁻¹·(b·DC_a - DC_a·b) = 0`
     where `W₂ = (2)⁻¹·(a'b - ba')` — pure ring identity in `a, b` proved by
     192-injective scalar clearing + ~20 `show (192 * products of inverses) = K`
     simp lemmas + `noncomm_ring`;
  3. `Id3`: linearity `L(W) = L(W_rest) + L(W₂)` where `W_rest = W - W₂` (noncomm_ring).
  Combining gives `Term5 = (12)⁻¹·L(W_rest) + (12)⁻¹·Q(W)`, where `W_rest =
  R₁ + C₃(a',b) + C₄(a',b)` has norm `O(s³)` and `W` has norm `O(s²)`.
  Final: `(7/12)·s²·‖W_rest‖ + (4/12)·‖W‖²·‖a'‖ ≤ 183·s⁵ + 2·s⁵ ≤ 250·s⁵`.
- **Triangle inequality:** `R₁ + R₂ + T3 + T4 + T5 + T6 ≤ 5000 + 5·10⁶ + 1000 + 1
  + 500 + 2 = 5,006,503 < 10⁷`, matching the statement's `10⁷·s⁵` constant.
- Downstream `norm_symmetric_bch_cubic_sub_smul_le` (`2·10⁷·|c|³·s⁵`) also closed.

Note: `Palindromic.lean` now imports `SymmetricQuintic.lean` (as of session 9)
so the B1.d per-block quintic wrapper
`norm_strangBlock_log_sub_quintic_target_le` can reference
`symmetric_bch_quintic_poly` and consume `norm_symmetric_bch_quintic_sub_poly_le`.
New import chain: `Basic → SymmetricQuintic → Palindromic → Suzuki5Quintic`.

## Lean-Trotter interface (branch `trotter-5factor-palindromic`)

Targeting Lean-Trotter's three BCH-interface axioms in
`LieTrotter/Suzuki4ViaBCH.lean`:
1. `bch_w4Deriv_quintic_level2` — unit-coefficient pointwise bound.
2. `bch_w4Deriv_level3_tight` — tight γᵢ at Suzuki p.
3. `bch_uniform_integrated` — order-7 + R₇ + FTC-2 integrated bound.

This branch closes axiom 1 prerequisites (but not axiom 1 itself yet).

### Done on this branch

- `BCH.commBr`, `BCH.childsComm₁..₈`, `BCH.bchFourFoldSum` —
  rfl-compatible mirror of Lean-Trotter defs.
- `BCH.IsSuzukiCubic_real_strict_bound` — for p : ℝ with IsSuzukiCubic p,
  we have 0 < p < 1.
- `BCH.suzuki5_β₁..β₈` — the 8 signed polynomial prefactors (from
  `Lean-Trotter/scripts/compute_bch_prefactors.py` CAS output).
- `BCH.abs_suzuki5_βᵢ_le_one` (i = 1..8) — each |βᵢ(p)| ≤ 1.
- `BCH.suzuki5_R5 A B p` — the τ⁵ Childs-basis combination, opaque.
- `BCH.norm_suzuki5_R5_le_bchFourFoldSum` — unit-coefficient norm bound.
- `BCH.norm_suzuki5_bch_sub_smul_sub_R5_le` — **headline theorem**:
  `∃ δ > 0, ∃ K ≥ 0, ∀ τ, ‖τ‖ < δ →
   ‖suzuki5_bch ℝ A B p τ − τ•(A+B) − τ⁵ • suzuki5_R5 A B p‖ ≤ K·‖τ‖⁶`
  under IsSuzukiCubic p. **Currently derived from the private
  `suzuki5_R5_identification_axiom`** (Tier-2 fallback per user's phase-1
  sanction). Signature ready for Lean-Trotter consumption.
- `BCH.suzuki5_log_product_quintic_of_IsSuzukiCubic` — **bridge corollary**:
  `∃ δ > 0, ∃ K ≥ 0, ∀ τ, 0 ≤ τ → τ < δ →
   ‖suzuki5_bch ℝ A B p τ − τ•(A+B)‖ ≤ τ⁵·bchFourFoldSum A B + K·τ⁶`.
  Triangle-inequality combination of the headline theorem with
  `norm_suzuki5_R5_le_bchFourFoldSum`. Lives in `Suzuki5Quintic.lean`
  (not `Palindromic.lean` — the import direction
  `Palindromic → Suzuki5Quintic → ChildsBasis` forces it here since the
  proof references both R₅ identification and the R₅ norm bound).

### Open (blocks full axiom 1 closure)

- **Discharging** `suzuki5_R5_identification_axiom` — see "Remaining axioms"
  above for the Tier 1/2/3 roadmap. The axiom existing as `private` gives
  Lean-Trotter a clean interface to pin against while the symbolic work
  happens in follow-up sessions.

### B1.c / B1.d closure (session 9, this branch)

**B1.c** — `BCH.norm_symmetric_bch_quintic_sub_poly_le` in
`BCH/SymmetricQuintic.lean`: the quintic Taylor bridge

```
‖symmetric_bch_cubic(a,b) − symmetric_bch_cubic_poly(a,b)
    − symmetric_bch_quintic_poly(a,b)‖ ≤ 10⁹ · (‖a‖+‖b‖)⁷
```

Currently derived from the scoped Tier-2 axiom
`BCH.symmetric_bch_quintic_sub_poly_axiom` (see "Remaining axioms"). CAS
at `Lean-Trotter/scripts/verify_strangblock_degree7.py` confirms the
statement structurally (degrees 2, 4, 6 vanish; degree 7 has 126 non-zero
words).

**B1.d** — `BCH.norm_strangBlock_log_sub_quintic_target_le` in
`BCH/Palindromic.lean`: per-block quintic bound

```
‖strangBlock_log A B c τ − (cτ)•(A+B) − (cτ)³•symmetric_bch_cubic_poly A B
    − (cτ)⁵•symmetric_bch_quintic_poly A B‖ ≤ 10⁹·(‖cτ•A‖+‖cτ•B‖)⁷
```

Trivial reduction via `norm_symmetric_bch_quintic_sub_poly_le` +
`symmetric_bch_cubic_poly_smul` + `symmetric_bch_quintic_poly_smul`.
Directly analogous to the existing cubic wrapper
`norm_strangBlock_log_sub_target_le`, one degree higher.

Both B1.c and B1.d depend only on the new Tier-2 axiom plus Lean's 3
standard (verified via `#print axioms`).

**B2.1 done (session 9)**: per-block quintic decomposition closed in
`BCH/Palindromic.lean`:

- `BCH.suzuki5_bch_quintic_coeff p := 4*p^5 + (1-4p)^5` — τ⁵ scalar
  coefficient (analog of the existing `suzuki5_bch_cubic_coeff`).
- `BCH.strangBlock_log_target_quintic` — per-block linear+cubic+quintic
  polynomial target (analog of `strangBlock_log_target` extended one
  degree).
- `BCH.suzuki5_targets_sum_quintic` and `BCH.target_quintic_sum_4_form`
  — pure algebraic identities (zero axioms, only standard).
- `BCH.norm_4X_plus_Y_sub_quintic_target_le` — bound on
  `‖4X+Y − τ•V − τ³·C₃·E_sym − τ⁵·C₅·E_quintic‖ ≤ K·τ⁷` (depends only
  on B1.c P3 axiom via B1.d, NOT on P1).
- `BCH.norm_suzuki5_bch_sub_smul_sub_quintic_le` — **B2 stepping stone**:
  combines `suzuki5_bch_eq_symmetric_bch` (M4a key step) with B1.c and
  B2.1 to give
  ```
  ‖suzuki5_bch − τ•V − C₃·τ³•E_sym − C₅·τ⁵•E_quintic
       − sym_cubic_poly(4X, Y) − sym_quintic_poly(4X, Y)‖ ≤ K·τ⁷
  ```
  Depends on P3 only (via B1.c). The remaining symbolic work for P1
  closure is to identify `sym_cubic_poly(4X, Y) + sym_quintic_poly(4X, Y)`
  (under `IsSuzukiCubic p`) with `τ⁵·suzuki5_R5 A B p`.

**B2.2.a + B2.2.b done (session 9)**: vanishing identities for the symmetric
poly's on scalar•V inputs (in `BCH/SymmetricQuintic.lean`):

- `BCH.symmetric_bch_quintic_poly_apply_smul_smul (V α β) :`
  `symmetric_bch_quintic_poly 𝕂 (α•V) (β•V) = 0`. Proof: each 5-letter
  word collapses to `(α^k·β^(5−k))•V⁵`; the sum of word coefficients per
  k-group is identically zero (k=4: 7−28+42−28+7=0; k=3:
  −28+72+12−48−48+12+32−48+72−28=0; k=2:
  32−48−48+32−48+192−48−48−48+32=0; k=1: −8+32−48+32−8=0; k∈{0,5}: no
  terms). Closed via `simp + ← add_smul + ring` after a 5-fold smul-mul
  absorption helper. Zero new axioms.
- `BCH.symmetric_bch_cubic_poly_apply_smul_smul (V α β) :`
  `symmetric_bch_cubic_poly 𝕂 (α•V) (β•V) = 0`. Trivial: the inner
  commutator `(α•V)(β•V) − (β•V)(α•V) = αβ·V² − αβ·V² = 0`. Zero new
  axioms.

**Significance**: These are the structural foundations for B2.2. They show
that the "leading τ⁵" contribution from `sym_cubic_poly(4X, Y)` and
`sym_quintic_poly(4X, Y)` (substituting only the linear `(cτ)•V` parts of
X, Y) vanishes identically. The non-zero τ⁵ contribution comes from the
"linear-in-residual" terms of `sym_cubic_poly(4X, Y)` (where one slot has
the `(cτ)³·E_sym` cubic residue), giving 4-fold commutators in V's
letters — exactly the Childs basis structure. The `sym_quintic_poly(4X, Y)`
contribution at τ⁵ is `0` (since linear-in-residual would be τ⁷, beyond
the τ⁵ window).

**Open**: **B2.2.c/B2.2.d** (multilinear Lipschitz bounds, ~few days) and
**B2.2.e** (symbolic τ⁵-to-Childs-basis projection, the ~weeks-long
symbolic work). Project the linear-in-residual part of
`sym_cubic_poly(4X, Y)` onto the Childs 4-fold commutator basis, matching
the βᵢ(p) prefactors in `BCH.suzuki5_R5`. CAS pipeline at
`Lean-Trotter/scripts/compute_bch_prefactors.py` already does this at
the symbolic level.

### Axiom 2 infrastructure (sessions 7–8, this branch)

Lean-BCH-side infrastructure for Lean-Trotter's `bch_w4Deriv_level3_tight`
is now FULLY PROVED (no P2 axiom). See "Rigorously proved" section
above for the full list. The bridge theorem
`BCH.suzuki5_log_product_quintic_tight_at_suzukiP` is ready for
Lean-Trotter-side axiom → theorem conversion.

### Axiom 3

Out of scope on this branch. Requires order-7 BCH + R₇ bound + FTC-2
integration.
