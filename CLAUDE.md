# Lean-BCH — Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff in Lean 4

## Status: ✅ H1, H2, M1 complete (0 sorry's, full build passes)

## Goal

Formalize the BCH formula and its truncated bounds in a general complete normed algebra,
with applications to product formula error analysis (Trotter, Strang, Suzuki).

## Constraints

- **Lean:** 4.29.0-rc8 (via `lean-toolchain`)
- **Mathlib:** pinned in `lake-manifest.json`
- **Typeclass setup:** `[NormedRing 𝔸] [NormedAlgebra 𝕂 𝔸] [NormOneClass 𝔸] [CompleteSpace 𝔸]`
- `include 𝕂 in` needed before theorems where `𝕂` appears in proofs but not in the type signature

## Relation to Lean-Trotter

The [Lean-Trotter](https://github.com/Jue-Xu/Lean-Trotter) project proves the first-order
Lie–Trotter formula `(exp(A/n)exp(B/n))^n → exp(A+B)` and second-order Strang splitting
using direct exp bounds. This BCH project provides:

- **H1** (`norm_bch_sub_add_sub_bracket_le`): Commutator extraction — identifies `[A,B]/2`
  as the leading BCH correction, with cubic remainder. Needed for Suzuki S₄.
- **H2** (`norm_symmetric_bch_sub_add_le`): Symmetric BCH — shows the `[A/2,B]` commutator
  cancels in `bch(bch(A/2,B),A/2)`, giving cubic error. This is the BCH-based proof that
  Strang splitting is second-order.

The Lean-Trotter `StrangSplitting.lean` proves second-order convergence via direct algebraic
splitting. The BCH approach here gives a cleaner route to higher-order (S₄) analysis.

## Key Techniques

### Non-commutative scalar issue
`(2:𝕂)⁻¹ • x` (scalar smul) doesn't interact with `noncomm_ring` or `abel`.
**Solution:** Multiply both sides by `(2:𝕂)`, clear via `smul_smul` + `inv_mul_cancel₀` +
`one_smul`, then use `noncomm_ring` on the scalar-free identity.

### Commutator cancellation in H2
Ring identity: `(z*a' - a'*z) + (a'*b - b*a') = (z-a'-b)*a' - a'*(z-a'-b)`.
Proved by `noncomm_ring`. Since `‖z-a'-b‖ = O(s²)`, the RHS is `O(s³)`.

### Taylor bounds for `nlinarith`
Feed `nlinarith` pre-computed bounds: `exp(s) ≤ 1+s+s²` (from `Real.norm_exp_sub_one_sub_id_le`),
`s⁴ ≤ s³` (for `s < 1`), `α³+β³ ≤ s³` (convexity), `αβ ≤ s²/4` (AM-GM).
