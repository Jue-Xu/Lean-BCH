# Lean-BCH — Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff in Lean 4

## Status (session 25, 2026-05-11)

Branch: `main`. Repository is **0 sorries**, **2 scoped private axioms**:
* `suzuki5_log_product_septic_at_suzukiP_axiom` (Lean-Trotter interface
  axiom 3, the target of the discharge roadmap).
* `symmetric_bch_septic_sub_poly_axiom` (NEW: stepping-stone for Stage 2;
  introduced session 25, mirrors how `symmetric_bch_quintic_sub_poly_axiom`
  was scaffolded before T2-F7e was discharged).

Discharge in progress; **Stages 1, 2.0, 2.1 (B1.d-septic + B2.1-septic),
and 3.0–3.3 of the 6-stage roadmap are now complete**.

**Session 25 (Stage 2.1 — B1.d-septic + B2.1-septic foundation)**:

- Added scoped private axiom `BCH.symmetric_bch_septic_sub_poly_axiom`
  in `SymmetricQuintic.lean` (new `SepticTaylorBridge` section). Asserts
  `‖sym_bch − sym_E₃ − sym_E₅ − sym_E₇‖ ≤ 10¹²·s⁹` for `s = ‖a‖+‖b‖ < 1/4`
  — the deg-9 analog of the discharged
  `symmetric_bch_quintic_sub_poly_axiom`. Public bridge theorem
  `BCH.norm_symmetric_bch_septic_sub_poly_le` re-exports it.

- Added `BCH.norm_strangBlock_log_sub_septic_target_le` in
  `Palindromic.lean` (B1.d-septic): each Strang block's log differs from
  the extended target `cτ•V + (cτ)³•E + (cτ)⁵•E₅ + (cτ)⁷·E₇` by at most
  `10¹²·σ⁹` where `σ = ‖cτ•A‖+‖cτ•B‖`. Thin wrapper around the new
  upstream axiom + the deg-7 homogeneity lemma `symmetric_bch_septic_poly_smul`.
  Analog of `norm_strangBlock_log_sub_quintic_target_le` at one degree higher.

- Added `BCH.norm_4X_plus_Y_sub_septic_target_le` in `Palindromic.lean`
  (B2.1-septic): bound on `‖4•X + Y − τ•V − C₃·τ³·E − C₅·τ⁵·E₅ − C₇·τ⁷·E₇‖`
  via per-block B1.d-septic + the algebraic identity
  `target_septic_sum_4_form` (Stage 2.0). Analog of
  `norm_4X_plus_Y_sub_quintic_target_le` at one degree higher.

- Added the `IsSuzukiCubic` corollary
  `BCH.norm_4X_plus_Y_sub_septic_target_of_IsSuzukiCubic_le`: under the
  Suzuki-cubic-vanishing condition, the τ³·C₃·E term drops, leaving the
  expected `τ•V + (τ⁵·C₅)·E₅ + (τ⁷·C₇)·E₇ + O(σ⁹)` decomposition.

**Net axiom shift**: 1 → 2 scoped private axioms. The new axiom is a
stepping stone with a clear discharge path (1-degree-higher analog of
the T2-F7e discharge); it unblocks the rest of Stage 2 + Stages 4–6 of
the septic-axiom roadmap without further upstream changes.

**Session 24 (septic axiom discharge, Stages 1 + 3.0)**:

**Session 24 (septic axiom discharge, Stages 1 + 3.0)**:

- **Stage 1 (complete)**: defined the explicit τ⁷ element
  `BCH.suzuki5_R7 A B p` (CAS-derived 126-word polynomial in `Fin 126 → 𝔸`
  Finset.sum form, with rational quadratic-in-p coefficients post-Suzuki
  reduction) and proved the norm bound
  `BCH.norm_suzuki5_R7_le_bchR7Bound : ‖suzuki5_R7 A B suzukiP‖ ≤ bchR7Bound A B`
  (= 0.01951 · max(‖A‖,‖B‖)^7). The proof uses a 126-case nlinarith match
  on `i : Fin 126` (each case bounds `|coef_i(suzukiP)|` via the rational
  interval `41449/100000 < suzukiP < 41450/100000`), plus
  `Fin.sum_univ_eq_sum_range + Finset.sum_range_succ` to evaluate
  `∑ K_i ≤ bchR7UniformConstant`. The Nat-indexed `r7BoundN` (with
  Fin-wrapper `r7Bound`) avoids the Fin.succ-normalization issue from
  session 23. (~1545 lines added in `BCH/Suzuki5Quintic.lean::SepticBridge`.)

  Also fixed pre-existing build break in `RHS_T1_le_aux` (3 unsolved goals
  from session 22's incomplete `1·10⁹ → 2·10¹⁰` bump). Added `τ ≤ 1/20`
  step derived from the regime hypothesis.

- **Stage 3.0 (complete)**: defined `BCH.symmetric_bch_septic_poly`
  (126-term explicit polynomial form for the τ⁷ Taylor coefficient of
  `log(exp(a/2)·exp(b)·exp(a/2))`, LCM 967680, Σ|coef|/967680 ≈ 0.086)
  + `seven_fold_smul_mul` helper + `symmetric_bch_septic_poly_smul`
  (`c⁷` homogeneity, 1-line via `simp only`) + norm bound
  `norm_symmetric_bch_septic_poly_le : ‖.‖ ≤ s⁷` via Finset.sum +
  uniform max (6912/967680) bound; 32M heartbeats. The deg-7 analog
  of `symmetric_bch_quintic_poly`. (~970 lines in `BCH/SymmetricQuintic.lean`.)

- **Stage 3.1 (complete)**: defined `BCH.symmetric_bch_septic_poly_apply_smul_smul`
  (vanishing on scalar•V inputs: `E₇(α•V, β•V) = 0`). Analog of B2.2.a at
  deg-7. Proof: collapse the 7-fold smul-product via `seven_fold_smul_mul_eq`,
  reduce to polynomial-in-(α, β) identity, close with `ring` (4M heartbeats
  for the 126-term ring proof).

- **Stage 3.2 (complete)**: `BCH.word_7_diff_le` (7-letter product Lipschitz
  helper, deg-7 analog of `word_5_diff_le`). Telescoping identity + 7
  per-term bounds via 6-step chained `norm_mul_le`. ~170 lines, 1.6M
  heartbeats.

- **Stage 3.3 (complete)**: `BCH.norm_symmetric_bch_septic_poly_apply_smul_add_smul_add_le`
  — the Lipschitz bound `‖E₇(α•V + δa, β•V + δb)‖ ≤ 7·N⁶·(‖δa‖+‖δb‖)`
  (analog of `norm_symmetric_bch_quintic_poly_apply_smul_add_smul_add_le`).

  Architecture (Finset.sum-based, ~1600 lines):
  - `deg7_smul_word_diff_le` (generic per-word helper).
  - `septicTerm_diff_norm_le` (126-case per-i diff bound, 64M heartbeats).
  - Final theorem via Stage 3.1's vanishing + Finset.sum_sub_distrib +
    per-i bound + Finset.sum_const (126 · 6912/967680 · 7 · N⁶·D = 6.3·N⁶·D ≤ 7·N⁶·D).

**The deg-7 infrastructure layer for Stage 2 is now complete:**
* `symmetric_bch_septic_poly` definition, homogeneity, norm bound (Stage 3.0).
* Vanishing on scalar·V inputs (Stage 3.1).
* `word_7_diff_le` (Stage 3.2).
* Lipschitz bound at perturbed scalar·V (Stage 3.3).

These are direct analogs of the deg-5 infrastructure in B2.2.a-c, which
was the workhorse for Stage 1's `norm_suzuki5_bch_sub_smul_sub_R5_le`.

- **Stage 2.0 (complete)**: deg-7 analog of strangBlock-log target
  infrastructure in `BCH/Palindromic.lean`:
  * `suzuki5_bch_septic_coeff p := 4p⁷ + (1-4p)⁷`.
  * `strangBlock_log_target_septic` (deg-1+3+5+7 truncation).
  * `suzuki5_targets_sum_septic` + `target_septic_sum_4_form` (algebraic
    sum identities, 1-line proofs via `match_scalars <;> ring`).

  Foundation for the full Stage 2 bound `‖4X+Y - septic_target‖ ≤ K·τ⁹·tail`
  (which would extend the existing B2.1 quintic version).

**CAS pipeline (new in session 24)**:
- `scripts/gen_lean_R7_data.py` — extracts per-word post-Suzuki coefficient
  polynomials + per-word rational K_w bounds (Σ K_w ≈ 0.0195099 vs target
  0.01951 — 10⁻⁶ slack).
- `scripts/gen_lean_R7_section.py` — emits the full Lean R7 section.
- `scripts/r7_data.txt` — 126-line tabular data.
- `scripts/gen_symmetric_bch_septic_poly.py` — emits the
  `symmetric_bch_septic_poly` def + homogeneity.
- `scripts/gen_septic_poly_norm_bound.py` — emits the deferred norm bound.

**Remaining Stages 2-6 (estimated ~2000 lines, multi-session work)**:
- Stage 2: 5-factor BCH septic remainder bound
  (`‖suzuki5_bch − sum-through-τ⁷‖ ≤ K·τ⁸`). Extends the existing R5
  regime-helper chain to handle τ⁷. Needs the deferred
  `norm_symmetric_bch_septic_poly_le` from Stage 3.0.
- Stage 3 (full): algebraic τ⁷ matching identity `(septic Taylor coeff
  of suzuki5_bch) = suzuki5_R7 A B p`. Likely via extending the cubic
  template's hdecomp + L_leading structure to deg-7.
- Stage 4: under_regime septic bound. Mirrors `norm_suzuki5_bch_sub_smul_sub_R5_le_under_regime`.
- Stage 5: polynomial RHS bound (extends `suzuki5_bch_sub_R5_RHS_le_aux`
  pattern to deg-8 tail).
- Stage 6: assembly + bridge at Suzuki p. Replaces the axiom with a theorem.

T2-F7e is FULLY PROVED from session 23.

**Session 23 (T2-F7e closure, complete)**: the per-term polynomial bound
`norm_C5_LinResidual_polynomial_le` (the only remaining axiom from session 22's
Phase E.2 stage 3b) is replaced with a proved theorem via:
- Refactor of `C5_LinResidual_polynomial` into a `Finset.sum` over `Fin 79/78/48`
  per-degree (`linResTerm7/8/9 : Fin n → 𝔸`, `linResBound7/8/9 : ℝ → Fin n → ℝ`).
- Per-degree algebraic identity (`C5_LinResidual_polynomial_eq_parts` +
  `C5_LinResidual_deg{N}_eq_sum`) proved by `unfold + abel`.
- Per-term norm bound (`linResTerm{N}_norm_le`) proved by `match i with | ⟨k, _⟩
  => show ... from deg{N}_smul_word_le ...` term-mode pattern matching.
- Per-degree sum bound (`sum_linResBound{N}_le`) via uniform per-i bound
  (max coefficient) + `Finset.sum_const`. Total bound: ~0.1·s⁷ ≪ 1·s⁷.
- ~1700 lines of generated Lean (script: `scripts/gen_lean_finset_norm_bound.py`).

**Key Lean-tactic lessons added in session 23**:
- `/-- doc -/` BEFORE `set_option ... in <lemma>` breaks Lean's doc-attachment
  parser. Use `--` regular comments instead for set_option'd declarations.
- For `match i : Fin n with | ⟨k, _⟩ => ...`, use term-mode `:= fun i => match i with`
  to avoid tactic-mode `=> by ...` parsing issues.
- `Finset.sum` of `Fin n` with `noncomputable def`s defined by pattern matching
  does not fully reduce via `simp only [Fin.sum_univ_succ, def_name]`. The
  `Fin.succ` chains aren't normalized, leaving `match Fin.succ 0 with ...`
  expressions. Workaround: use uniform per-i bound + `Finset.sum_const`
  (looser but provable bound).
- `private def` of a function returning `ℝ` (e.g., `linResBound{N} (s : ℝ) :
  Fin n → ℝ`) must be marked `noncomputable` due to `Real.instDivInvMonoid`.

**Session 22 (Phase E.1 of T2-F7e discharge, complete)**: parent axiom
discharged modulo the Group C+D sub-axiom. The parent theorem
`norm_symmetric_bch_quintic_sub_poly_le` now uses:
- Phase A inner septic remainder bound (R₁_sept ≤ 1.5·10⁶·s⁷)
- Phase A outer septic remainder bound (R₂_sept ≤ 1.2·10¹⁰·s⁷)
- Phase E.1 inline bounds (5 easy pieces):
  * ‖½·[R₁_sept, a']‖ ≤ 1.875·10⁵·s⁷
  * ‖½·[C₆(a',b), a']‖ ≤ s⁷
  * ‖C₆(z,a') - C₆(a'+b,a')‖ ≤ 5500·s⁷ (via `norm_bch_sextic_term_diff_le`)
- Group C+D sub-axiom (10⁸·s⁷ stepping-stone for Phase E.2)
- Phase D's `symmetric_bch_quintic_extended_hdecomp` for the 13-piece
  decomposition + triangle inequality through it

**Constant change**: parent theorem bound `10⁹·s⁷` → `2·10¹⁰·s⁷`. The
original `10⁹` was incompatible with Phase A's `1.2·10¹⁰` outer bound.
Updated 21 sites in `Palindromic.lean` and 23 in `Suzuki5Quintic.lean`.

**`norm_bch_inner_septic_remainder_le` and `norm_bch_outer_septic_remainder_le`**
made public (removed `private`) so Phase E.1 can use them externally.

**Helper lemma added**: `norm_half_smul_bracket_le`
(`‖(2:𝕂)⁻¹ • (X*Y - Y*X)‖ ≤ ‖X‖·‖Y‖`).

**Session 22 step 2 (Phase E.2 step 1, complete)**: algebraic identity
proved. The central rearrangement of `Group C + Group D` as a sum of 3
explicit deg-7+ residuals via Phase B + Phase C cancellation identities is
now proved as `BCH.group_CD_eq_three_residuals`.

```
Group C + Group D = R_T5_sept + R_T6_sept + C5_diff_residual
```

The proof is 1-line: `linear_combination (norm := abel) hB + hC` where
hB = Phase B identity, hC = Phase C identity. ~120 lines (mostly the
explicit residual statement).

**Session 22 step 3 (Phase E.1+E.2 step 1 fix-up)**: build was broken at
HEAD due to multiple latent issues introduced by ce83486 (Phase E.1) and
d40ce65 (Phase E.2 step 1). Fixed:
- Made `BCH.real_exp_third_order_le_cube` public (Phase E.1 inline needed it).
- Reordered doc-comment + `set_option ... in` for the parent theorem
  (Lean disallows `/-- doc -/ set_option ... in theorem`).
- Fixed `linear_combination` sign error in `group_CD_eq_three_residuals`
  (`-hB + hC` → `hB + hC`).
- Removed redundant `rw [hz_def]` after `convert h using 2` in Phase E.1
  inline term setup.
- Tightened `(45/11)^5 ≤ 184` to `(45/11)^5 ≤ 1146` (correct numerical bound).
- Restructured `set T_CD` (which didn't fold the goal due to parenthesization
  mismatch in the 13-piece sum) as explicit abel re-association to
  (T₁..T₅) + CD_SUM, then triangle inequality.

Net: build clean, 0 sorries, 2 scoped private axioms (parent Group C+D
sub-axiom + Suzuki5 septic axiom). HEAD now compiles.

**Session 22 step 5 (Phase E.2 step 2b, complete)**: norm bound on R_T5_sept
proved. Adds `BCH.norm_R_T5_sept_le`:

```
‖R_T5_sept‖ ≤ 7·10⁶·s⁷  (for s = ‖a‖+‖b‖ < 1/4)
```

Bounds:
- ‖(1/12)·L_C3(a'+b, WHigh, a')‖ ≤ 225,000·s⁷ (12·max(‖a'+b‖,‖a'‖)²·‖WHigh‖
  with max ≤ 3s/2, ‖WHigh‖ ≤ 100,000·s⁵).
- ‖(1/12)·Q_residual‖ ≤ 6,004,167·s⁷ (dominated by Q(WRestSept, WRestSept)
  with ‖WRestSept‖ ≤ 6000·s³).

Total ≤ 6,229,167·s⁷ < 7,000,000·s⁷ ✓.

Foundation helpers added in `SymmetricQuintic.lean`:
- `BCH.norm_triple_le_aux`: `‖X*Y*Z‖ ≤ ‖X‖·‖Y‖·‖Z‖`.
- `BCH.norm_Q_form_le_aux`: 4-term Q-bilinear bracket bound.

Key lesson: `linarith` failed in the final triangle inequality step
(expression-matching approach); replaced with `add_le_add hL_final hQ_final`
which uses direct unification.

**Session 22 step 4 (Phase E.2 step 2a, complete)**: R_T5_sept algebraic
decomposition proved. Adds `BCH.R_T5_sept_decomp_eq`:

```
R_T5_sept = (1/12) · L_C3(a'+b, WHigh, a') + (1/12) · Q_residual
```

where `WHigh := V₅ + V₆ + R₁_sept` (deg-5+ part of W after V₂, V₃, V₄
extracted), and `Q_residual := Q(V₂, WMid) + Q(WMid, V₂) + Q(WRestSept, WRestSept)`
is a sum of 3 deg-7+ bilinear cross terms. Each piece is naturally O(s⁷):
- ‖(1/12)·L_C3‖ ≤ 12·s²·‖WHigh‖/12 = s²·‖WHigh‖ ≈ 100,000·s⁷ (max(‖x‖,‖y‖)
  bounded by max(3s/2, s/2) ≈ 3s/2; ‖WHigh‖ ≤ 100,000·s⁵ for s ≤ 1/4 since
  ‖R₁_sept‖ ≤ 1.5·10⁶·s⁷).
- ‖(1/12)·Q_residual‖ ≤ 6·10⁶·s⁷ (dominated by Q(WRestSept, WRestSept)
  with ‖WRestSept‖ ≤ 6000·s³).

Total estimate: ‖R_T5_sept‖ ≤ ~6·10⁶·s⁷ (matching CLAUDE.md plan).

Foundation lemma added to `Basic.lean`:
- `BCH.bch_cubic_term_LQ_decomp`: standalone L+Q decomposition of
  `bch_cubic_term(x+W, y) - bch_cubic_term(x, y)`. Used by R_T5_sept
  decomposition to expose the linear-in-W and quadratic-in-W structure of
  T₅ explicitly (matches cubic template's L_W and Q_W shapes).

Proof structure: substitute z = (a'+b) + (V₂+V₃+V₄+V₅+V₆+R₁_sept) (true
by R₁_sept's definition), apply LQ decomp, then `match_scalars <;> ring`
closes the polynomial identity (with V₃, V₄, V₅, V₆, R₁_sept kept as
atoms; V₂ unfolded for the cubic-identity cancellation with
(96)⁻¹·(b·DC_a - DC_a·b)). 64M heartbeats, ~140 lines.

**Session 22 step 6 (Phase E.2 step 3 foundation, complete)**: added
`BCH.bch_quartic_term_LQ_decomp` foundation lemma in `Basic.lean`
(analogous to `bch_cubic_term_LQ_decomp`):

```
C₄(x+W, y) - C₄(x, y) = (1/24) · L_C4(x, W, y) + (1/24) · Q_C4(W, y)
```

L_C4 is linear-in-W (8 sub-terms), Q_C4 is quadratic-in-W (4 sub-terms).
12+6 = 18 multiplicities total. Proof: 1-line `unfold + simp + match_scalars`.

**Session 22 step 7 (Phase E.2 step 3, complete)**: R_T6_sept algebraic
decomposition + norm bound. Adds `BCH.R_T6_sept_decomp_eq` and
`BCH.norm_R_T6_sept_le`:

```
R_T6_sept = (1/24)·L_C4(a'+b, WHigh4, a') + (1/24)·(Q_C4(WRest6, a') + Q_bilin(V₂, WRest6, a'))
‖R_T6_sept‖ ≤ 10⁶·s⁷  (for s = ‖a‖+‖b‖ < 1/4)
```

Where:
- WHigh4 := V₄+V₅+V₆+R₁_sept (deg-4+, ‖.‖ ≤ 25000·s⁴).
- WRest6 := V₃+V₄+V₅+V₆+R₁_sept (deg-3+, ‖.‖ ≤ 6000·s³).
- L_C4 contributes ~5000·s⁷, Q_C4(WRest6,a') contributes ~600000·s⁷ (the
  dominant term, deg-8 truncated to s⁷ via s ≤ 1/4), Q_bilin contributes
  ~10000·s⁷. Total ~610000·s⁷ ≤ 10⁶·s⁷.

Proof structure mirrors R_T5_sept (12-term L decomposition + Q residual).
Adds 2 helpers: `norm_LC4_template_le` (12-term form) and `norm_QC4_template_le`
(6-term form), both via `norm_quad_le_aux` (4-letter products). 64M heartbeats
for the algebraic identity, 1.6M for the norm bound. ~600 lines total.

**Session 22 step 8 (Phase E.2 steps 4-5, axiomatized + theorem-replaced)**:
The Group C+D sub-axiom is REPLACED with a proved theorem
`BCH.symmetric_bch_quintic_group_CD_le`, which combines:
- `norm_R_T5_sept_le` (proved, ≤ 7·10⁶·s⁷)
- `norm_R_T6_sept_le` (proved, ≤ 10⁶·s⁷)
- `BCH.symmetric_bch_quintic_C5_diff_residual_axiom` (focused axiom, ≤ 10⁵·s⁷)

via `group_CD_eq_three_residuals` (algebraic identity) + triangle inequality.
Total: 7·10⁶ + 10⁶ + 10⁵ = 8.1·10⁶·s⁷ ≤ 10⁸·s⁷ (matches old axiom bound).

**Net axiom shift**: Group C+D axiom (10⁸·s⁷, 8 pieces) → C5_diff_residual
axiom (10⁵·s⁷, 1 piece). Same axiom count (2), but the new axiom is far
more focused: a 1000× tighter constant on a single deg-7+ residual.

The C5_diff_residual full discharge requires either an L+Q+higher
decomposition of `bch_quintic_term` in its first arg (analog of the
cubic/quartic LQ_decomp foundations, but with 76+ linear-in-V₂ and
quadratic-in-V₂ subterms — ~500 lines of polynomial identity work) OR
an alternative Lipschitz-of-V₂ structural argument. Future work.

**Session 22 step 12 (Phase E.2 stage 3b: parent axiom replaced; polynomial
axiom remaining, complete)**: the BCH-theory axiom
`symmetric_bch_quintic_C5_diff_residual_axiom` is REPLACED with a proved
theorem `BCH.symmetric_bch_quintic_C5_diff_residual_le`, derived from:
- `C5_LinResidual_at_V2_eq_polynomial` (algebraic identity, Stage 3a).
- `norm_bch_quintic_term_diff_le` (Lipschitz on z vs (a'+b)+V₂).
- `norm_bch_inner_septic_remainder_le` (Phase A WRest6 bound).
- `BCH.norm_C5_LinResidual_polynomial_le` (NEW focused axiom).

The new axiom `norm_C5_LinResidual_polynomial_le` is much more focused
than the original: it asserts only that
`‖C5_LinResidual_polynomial 𝕂 a b‖ ≤ 1·s⁷` where `C5_LinResidual_polynomial`
is the specific 205-term polynomial in (a, b) (CAS-verified Σ|coef|·s^d ≤
0.022·s⁷ for s ≤ 1/4). This bound is "trivially" true by triangle
inequality, but requires ~3000-4400 lines of mechanical Lean code due to
per-term enumeration.

Made `norm_5prod_le`, `norm_6prod_le`, `norm_7prod_le`, `norm_8prod_le`,
`norm_9prod_le` non-private in `Basic.lean` for cross-file use.

Net axiom count: still 2 scoped private. Structural shift:
- BEFORE: BCH-theory axiom asserting a complex LHS bound (10⁵·s⁷
  originally, then 5·10⁶·s⁷ post-Stage 1).
- AFTER: focused polynomial-norm-only axiom asserting a triangle-trivial
  bound on a fully-explicit polynomial in (a, b).

The remaining work for full T2-F7e closure (1 axiom remaining → 0):
1. Discharge `norm_C5_LinResidual_polynomial_le` via either:
   - Refactor `C5_LinResidual_polynomial` as `Finset.sum` over a list of
     `(coef, word)` pairs; apply `Finset.norm_sum_le` directly (~300-500
     lines, cleanest).
   - Split per-degree (79+78+48 sub-lemmas to limit context growth).
   - Patient compilation of the brute-force ~3000-line proof
     (`scripts/gen_lean_norm_bound_final.py` generates this).

After this discharge, T2-F7e is fully proved; only
`suzuki5_log_product_septic_at_suzukiP_axiom` remains as the Lean-Trotter
axiom 3 for the overall Suzuki-5 BCH framework.

**Session 22 step 11 (Phase E.2 stage 3a: C5 LinResidual algebraic
identity, complete)**: the core algebraic foundation for discharging the
C5_diff_residual axiom is now proved. Key lemmas in `SymmetricQuintic.lean`:

- `BCH.C5_LinResidual_polynomial`: explicit deg-7+ polynomial def in (a, b)
  with 205 monomials (79 deg-7 + 78 deg-8 + 48 deg-9). Common denominators
  in {92160, 184320, 368640}. Σ|coef|/denom ≈ 0.027.

- `BCH.C5_LinResidual_at_V2_eq_polynomial`: pure polynomial identity
  proving `((C₅((a'+b)+V₂, a') - C₅(a'+b, a')) - ΔC₅_lin_explicit)
  = C5_LinResidual_polynomial 𝕂 a b`. This isolates the deg-6 cancellation
  between the C₅ linearization at V₂ and ΔC₅_lin_explicit (Phase C insight),
  leaving only the deg-7+ residual.

  Proof: `match_scalars + ring` after unfolding all 4 `bch_quintic_group_*`,
  V₂, and a'. Used 1024M heartbeats (~10 min CPU). 310 lines added.

CAS verification (in `scripts/`):
- `compute_C5_diff_LinResidual.py`: symbolic expansion verifying the
  polynomial identity numerically. Confirms deg-6 cancellation.
- `generate_C5_full_lean.py`: emits Lean code for the polynomial def.
- `gen_lean_norm_bound_final.py`: scaffold for next-stage norm bound
  (generates ~4400 lines of mechanical Lean code).

**Stage 3b remaining for full discharge** (deferred):
- `norm_C5_LinResidual_polynomial_le`: triangle inequality on the 205-term
  polynomial. Each term `(c/d : 𝕂) • word` with d-letter word in {a, b}
  bounded by `|c|/d · s^d`. Sum ≤ K·s⁷ where K = Σ|coef|/d · s^(d-7) for
  s ≤ 1/4 conversion. Estimated ~3000-4400 lines mechanical Lean code
  (one calc block per term + chained `norm_add_le` + final linarith).

  Likely needs structural refactoring to avoid compile-time blowup:
  consider splitting per-degree (7, 8, 9), or using Finset.sum encoding,
  or bundling per-monomial bounds via a generic `norm_word_le_pow_s`
  helper (`‖letter₁·letter₂·...·letterₙ‖ ≤ s^n` for letters in {a, b}).

- Main theorem `symmetric_bch_quintic_C5_diff_residual_le` (replaces axiom):
  combines the algebraic identity + LinResidual bound (≤ 1·s⁷) +
  Lipschitz piece (`norm_bch_quintic_term_diff_le` for z vs (a'+b)+V₂,
  bounded by ~2·10⁶·s⁷) via triangle. Total ≤ 5·10⁶·s⁷ ✓.

After Stage 3b, T2-F7e is fully discharged.

**Session 22 step 10 (Phase E.2 stage 2: per-group LQ_decomps, complete)**:
implemented foundation lemmas in `Basic.lean` for the C5_diff_residual
axiom discharge. Each `BCH.bch_quintic_group_k_LQ_decomp` (k=1, 4, 6, 24)
expresses `group_k(x+W, y) - group_k(x, y)` as a sum of explicit sub-terms
by W-count (linear, quadratic, cubic, quartic in W).

Total: 180 sub-terms across 4 lemmas:
- group_1 (4 monomials): 32 sub-terms (10+12+8+2).
- group_4 (10 monomials): 62 sub-terms (25+24+11+2). Heartbeats 1.6M.
- group_6 (14 monomials): 76 sub-terms (35+30+10+1). Heartbeats 3.2M.
- group_24 (2 monomials): 10 sub-terms (5+4+1).

Sum matches Σ(2^k - 1) over all 30 monomials of `bch_quintic_term`
(k = #a's per monomial). Each proof: 1-line `unfold + noncomm_ring`.
Algebraic verification: expanding (x+W)^k for k a-positions gives 2^k
sub-terms; subtracting all-x leaves 2^k - 1.

Stage 3 (next session, ~200-400 lines): use these to discharge the
C5_diff_residual axiom. Apply at x = a'+b, W = V₂, y = a'. Identify
linear-in-V₂ form with ΔC₅_lin_explicit (match_scalars + ring identity),
bound quadratic+cubic+quartic-in-V₂ via per-monomial triangle inequality
(each is naturally O(s⁷+) since ‖V₂‖ ≤ s²/2). Combine with Lipschitz
piece (z vs (a'+b)+V₂) via triangle. Total bound ≈ 2·10⁶·s⁷ ≤ 5·10⁶·s⁷.

**Session 22 step 9 (axiom constant correction, complete)**: bumped
`symmetric_bch_quintic_C5_diff_residual_axiom` constant from 10⁵·s⁷ to
5·10⁶·s⁷ for satisfiability. The original 10⁵·s⁷ was unsatisfiable
because the realistic upper bound (Lipschitz piece M⁴·‖WRest6‖) is
≈ 1.9·10⁶·s⁷:
- M = ‖z‖+‖(a'+b)+V₂‖+‖a'‖ ≤ 4.22·s (using ‖z‖ ≤ 23/11·s,
  ‖(a'+b)+V₂‖ ≤ 13s/8 for s ≤ 1/4, ‖a'‖ ≤ s/2).
- ‖WRest6‖ = ‖V₃+V₄+V₅+V₆+R₁_sept‖ ≤ s³+s⁴+s⁵+s⁶+1.5·10⁶·s⁷ ≤ 6000·s³,
  dominated by Phase A's R₁_sept bound.
- M⁴·‖WRest6‖ ≤ (4.22)⁴·6000·s⁷ ≈ 1.9·10⁶·s⁷.

Plus the linearization residual at V₂ (algebraic): bounded by
K_2·M_max³·‖V₂‖² + smaller ≤ 0.5·s⁷ (negligible).

Total realistic bound ≈ 2·10⁶·s⁷; axiom uses 5·10⁶·s⁷ for ~2.5x safety.

Group C+D total bound: 7·10⁶ + 10⁶ + 5·10⁶ = 1.3·10⁷·s⁷ ≤ 10⁸·s⁷ ✓.

**Next session priority**: Phase E.2 step 4 full discharge:
- Implement `BCH.bch_quintic_term_LQ_decomp` foundation in `Basic.lean`.
  This is a large polynomial identity: C₅(x+W, y) - C₅(x, y) =
  (1/720)·(L_C5 + Q_C5 + Cu_C5 + Q4_C5) where
  - L_C5 (linear-in-W): 75 entries, weighted sum 440 = 11/18·720
  - Q_C5 (quadratic-in-W): 70 entries, weighted sum 384 = 8/15·720
  - Cu_C5 (cubic-in-W): 30 entries, weighted sum 136 = 17/90·720
  - Q4_C5 (quartic-in-W): 5 entries, weighted sum 16 = 2/90·720
  - Q5_C5 (quintic-in-W): 0 (no monomial has all 5 a's).
  Total 180 explicit monomials. Proof: 1-line `unfold + match_scalars + ring`,
  estimated 256M-512M heartbeats. ~250-300 lines.

  Best implemented per-group (4 separate LQ_decomp lemmas for
  group_1, group_4, group_6, group_24, sizes ~32, 62, 76, 10 entries
  respectively), then combined.

- Identity: (1/720)·L_C5(a'+b, V₂, a') = ΔC₅_lin_explicit (after
  V₂ → ½(a'·b - b·a'), a' → a/2). Proof: `match_scalars + ring`. ~50-100 lines.

- Use to discharge the C5_diff_residual axiom:
  - Split: C5_diff_residual = (C₅(z,a')-C₅(z₁,a')) +
    (C₅(z₁,a')-C₅(a'+b,a') - ΔC₅_lin_explicit) where z₁ = (a'+b)+V₂.
  - Bound piece 1 via existing `norm_bch_quintic_term_diff_le`: ≤ 2·10⁶·s⁷.
  - Bound piece 2 = (1/720)·(Q+Cu+Q4) at W=V₂: ≤ 1·s⁷ via per-form bounds.
  - Triangle: total ≤ 2·10⁶·s⁷ + 1·s⁷ ≤ 5·10⁶·s⁷. ~200-300 lines.

- Replace `symmetric_bch_quintic_C5_diff_residual_axiom` with proved theorem.
  T2-F7e is then fully discharged.

Total estimated work: ~600-1000 lines, possibly 2-3 sessions.

After that, T2-F7e is fully discharged, leaving only the
`suzuki5_log_product_septic_at_suzukiP_axiom` (axiom 3) for the
overall Suzuki-5 BCH framework.

**Phase E.2 plan** (algebraic decomposition + per-residual bounds):

The Group C+D sub-axiom asserts:
```
‖Group C + Group D‖ ≤ 10⁸·s⁷
```
where Group C = T₅ + T₆ + ½[C₄(a',b),a'] - correction and Group D =
½[C₅(a',b),a'] + C₆(a',b) + C₆(a'+b,a') + (C₅(z,a') - C₅(a'+b,a')).

By Phase B + Phase C identities, this equals 3 deg-7+ residuals:
- `R_T5_sept` := T₅ - ΔC₃_lin(V₃) - ΔC₃_quad(V₂) - T5_d6_op (~6·10⁶·s⁷)
- `R_T6_sept` := T₆ - ΔC₄_lin(V₂) - T6_d6_op (~10⁷·s⁷)
- `C5_diff_residual` := (C₅(z,a') - C₅(a'+b,a')) - ΔC₅_lin (~10⁴·s⁷)

Each residual decomposes into Lipschitz-bounded pieces:
- `R_T5_sept = (1/12)·(L_R₁_sept + L_C₅ + L_C₆) + (1/12)·Q_residual`
  where `Q_residual = Q(W'_septic, W'_septic) + Q_bilin(V₂, V₄+C₅+C₆+R₁_sept)`,
  `W'_septic = V₃+V₄+C₅+C₆+R₁_sept`. Each piece deg-7+.
- `R_T6_sept`: similar L+Q decomposition for C₄ Taylor.
- `C5_diff_residual`: triangle through `norm_bch_quintic_term_diff_le`.

**Phase E.2 sub-tasks**:
1. Algebraic identity (Group C+D = R_T5_sept + R_T6_sept + C5_diff_residual)
   via Phase B+C identities (~50 lines, pure ring).
2. Bound `R_T5_sept` (~300 lines): cubic-template-style hT5_id extension +
   norm bounds on Q_residual (19 sub-terms) and L_remaining.
3. Bound `R_T6_sept` (~300 lines): similar for C₄.
4. Bound `C5_diff_residual` (~200 lines): Lipschitz on quintic term diff.
5. Triangle inequality + constant comparison (~50 lines).
6. Replace Group C+D sub-axiom with proven theorem.

The proof structure mirrors the cubic template `norm_symmetric_bch_cubic_sub_poly_le`
in `Basic.lean`, which uses the analog hT5_id and hT6_id decompositions
(but at one degree lower, giving O(s⁵) bounds).

**Session 21 step 11 (Phase C of T2-F7e discharge, complete)**:
deg-6 cancellation algebraic identity. CAS verified at
`Lean-Trotter/scripts/verify_t2f7e_deg6_cancellation.py`; Lean theorem
`symmetric_bch_quintic_deg6_cancellation_pure_identity` in
`SymmetricQuintic.lean`.

The theorem states (with `a' := ½a`, `V₂ := ½·[a',b]`, `V₃ := C₃(a',b)`,
`V₄ := C₄(a',b) = bch_quartic_term(a',b)`, `x := a'+b`):
  (deg-6 of T₅) + (deg-6 of T₆) + ½·[C₅(a',b), a']
  + bch_sextic_term(a', b) + bch_sextic_term(a'+b, a')
  + (deg-6 of [C₅(z, a') − C₅(a'+b, a')])  =  0

reflecting palindromic vanishing of even degrees in
`log(exp(½a)·exp(b)·exp(½a))`.

**Discharge approach** (5 sub-lemmas + 1 inline polynomial + combine, ~470 lines):
- `T5_d6_eq` (piece 1): 26-monomial polynomial form for
  `ΔC₃_lin(V₄, x, a') + (1/12)·([V₂,[V₃,a']] + [V₃,[V₂,a']])`.
  Heartbeats: 32M (V₄ = bch_quartic_term unfolds heavily).
- `T6_d6_eq` (piece 2): 32-monomial form for
  `ΔC₄_lin(V₃, x, a') + ΔC₄_quad(V₂, x, a')`. Heartbeats: 16M.
- `half_C5_bracket_eq` (piece 3): 38-monomial form for
  `½·[bch_quintic_term(a/2, b), a/2]`. Heartbeats: 16M. Required full
  simp set including `neg_mul, mul_neg, neg_neg, neg_smul, smul_neg,
  sub_neg_eq_add` to handle bch_quintic_term's leading negation.
- `C6_inner_eq` (piece 4): 28-monomial form for `bch_sextic_term(a/2, b)`.
- `C6_static_eq` (piece 5): 42-monomial form for `bch_sextic_term(a/2 + b, a/2)`.
- Piece 6 (`ΔC₅_lin(V₂, x, a')`, no clean commutator form): inlined as
  36-monomial polynomial directly in the combine theorem.
- Combine: `rw [T5_d6_eq, T6_d6_eq, half_C5_bracket_eq, C6_inner_eq,
  C6_static_eq] ; match_scalars <;> ring`.

All 6 pieces share common denominator 46080.

**Lean-tactic lessons added in step 11**:
- `bch_quintic_term` has TWO leading negations (`-bch_quintic_group_1` AND
  `- (6:𝕂) • bch_quintic_group_6`); both require the full negation simp
  set (`neg_mul, mul_neg, neg_neg, neg_smul, smul_neg, sub_neg_eq_add`)
  for `match_scalars <;> ring` to canonicalize. Without these, residues
  like `1/2880 = 0`, `1/11520 = 1/9216` appear.
- Doc comments `/-- ... -/` cannot be placed BETWEEN `set_option ... in`
  and `theorem`; the `in` interrupts attachment. Use regular `--` comments
  for private theorem documentation when `set_option` is needed.

**Session 21 steps 9–10 (Phase B of T2-F7e discharge, complete)**:
deg-5 cancellation algebraic identity. CAS verified at
`Lean-Trotter/scripts/verify_t2f7e_deg5_cancellation.py`; Lean theorem
`symmetric_bch_quintic_deg5_cancellation_pure_identity` in
`SymmetricQuintic.lean`.

The theorem states (with `a' := ½a`, `V₂ := ½·[a',b]`, `V₃ := C₃(a',b)`,
`x := a'+b`):
  ΔC₃_lin(V₃, x, a') + ΔC₃_quad(V₂, x, a') + ΔC₄_lin(V₂, x, a')
  + ½·[C₄(a', b), a'] = correction(a, b)

**Discharge approach** (4 sub-lemmas + combine, ~250 lines total):
- `deltaC3_lin_V3_eq` (sub-lemma A): 20-monomial polynomial form for ΔC₃_lin(V₃).
- `deltaC3_quad_V2_eq` (sub-lemma B): 8-monomial form for ΔC₃_quad(V₂).
- `deltaC4_lin_V2_eq` (sub-lemma C): 12-monomial form for ΔC₄_lin(V₂).
- `half_C4_bracket_eq` (sub-lemma D): 7-monomial form for ½·[C₄(a',b), a'].
- Each sub-lemma proves piece = explicit polynomial via
  `simp only [show let-name = ... from rfl] ; (unfold bch_*_term ;)
  simp only [neg_mul, mul_neg, neg_neg, neg_smul, smul_neg, smul_sub, ...] ;
  match_scalars <;> ring`. Common denominator across all 4: 2304.
- Combine: `rw [hA, hB, hC, hD] ; unfold correction_poly ; match_scalars <;> ring`.

**Key Lean-tactic lessons** (added to feedback memory):
1. For sub-lemmas with `unfold bch_*_term` introducing negation: must include
   `neg_mul, mul_neg, neg_neg` in the simp set (not just `neg_smul, smul_neg`).
2. For lemmas where the LHS starts with `-(...)` after a `let`-block: parser
   chokes; use `(0 : 𝔸) - X - Y` form instead.
3. Direct monolithic `match_scalars <;> ring` on a 7-summand identity with
   nested `(2:𝕂)⁻¹` smul factors fails (residues like `5/1152 = 11/1152`,
   `1/4 = 0`); splitting into per-ΔC sub-lemmas fixes this.
4. After applying sub-lemma rewrites, must `unfold correction_poly` before
   `match_scalars <;> ring` (otherwise `0 = 1` residue).

**Session 21 steps 1-8 (Phase A of T2-F7e discharge)** (~211 lines in `Basic.lean`,
inserted after the cubic template at line 11229): two private helper
lemmas packaging the inner+outer septic remainder bounds for the eventual
parent discharge.

- `BCH.norm_bch_inner_septic_remainder_le`: bound on
  `‖bch(½a, b) − ((½a+b) + ½[½a,b] + C₃ + C₄ + C₅ + C₆)‖ ≤ 1.5·10⁶ · s⁷`
  for `s = ‖a‖+‖b‖ < 1/4`. ~58 lines. Direct from
  `norm_bch_septic_remainder_le` at `(½a, b)` with `s₁ ≤ s` and
  `2 − exp(s₁) ≥ 11/16`.
- `BCH.norm_bch_outer_septic_remainder_le`: bound on
  `‖bch(z, ½a) − ((z+½a) + ½[z,½a] + C₃ + C₄ + C₅ + C₆)(z, ½a)‖ ≤
  1.2·10¹⁰ · s⁷` where `z := bch(½a, b)`. ~129 lines. Mirrors the
  cubic-template scaffolding for s₂ := ‖z‖+‖½a‖: establishes
  `‖z‖ ≤ (23/11)·s`, `s₂ ≤ (57/22)·s`, `s₂ ≤ 57/88`, `2 − exp(s₂) ≥ 1/12`
  (via `Real.exp_bound'`), then applies `norm_bch_septic_remainder_le` at
  `(z, ½a)`. The constant absorbs `1000010·(57/22)^7·12 ≈ 9.4·10⁹` with
  margin (uses `(57/22)^7 ≤ 784` numerical step).

Maxheartbeats: 800K (inner) and 1.6M (outer signature elaboration +
nlinarith with `(57/22)^7` numerical step).

**Session 21 step 12 (Phase D of T2-F7e discharge, complete)**:
extended hdecomp algebraic identity. Lean theorem
`symmetric_bch_quintic_extended_hdecomp` in `SymmetricQuintic.lean`.

The theorem states the algebraic decomposition of
`sym_bch_cubic - sym_E₃ - sym_E₅` into 13 sub-pieces (organized into
4 groups: sept-related, C₆-related, Phase B group, Phase C group). The
proof extends the cubic template's hdecomp from `Basic.lean` by:
1. Substituting the sym_E₃ alt-form (via `symmetric_bch_cubic_poly_alt_form`).
2. Substituting the sym_E₅ alt-form (via `symmetric_bch_quintic_poly_alt_form`).
3. Using septic R-definitions instead of quintic R-definitions (extra C₅, C₆
   subtractions).
4. Using `symmetric_bch_quartic_identity` for deg-4 cancellation.

Made `symmetric_bch_quartic_identity` and `symmetric_bch_cubic_poly_alt_form`
public (removed `private` keyword) so Phase D can reuse them. ~150 lines
in SymmetricQuintic.lean. Heartbeats: 8M.

Closing tactic: `match_scalars <;> ring` (after simp distribution) — the
modern alternative to cubic template's `linear_combination + abel`, which
requires only the explicit a' unfold (`show a' = (2:𝕂)⁻¹ • a from rfl`)
to align all atoms.

**Next session priority**: Phase E (per-piece norm bounds + triangle
assembly + axiom replacement). Estimated ~500 lines.

**Phase E plan** (the final step of T2-F7e parent discharge):

The parent theorem replaces `symmetric_bch_quintic_sub_poly_axiom`. The
proof uses Phase D's `symmetric_bch_quintic_extended_hdecomp` to express
`sym_bch_cubic - sym_E₃ - sym_E₅` as 13 sub-pieces, then bounds each:

**Phase E.1: 5 easy pieces** (~150 lines, each O(s⁷)):
- `R₁_sept` ≤ 1.5·10⁶·s⁷ — direct from Phase A `norm_bch_inner_septic_remainder_le`.
- `R₂_sept` ≤ 1.2·10¹⁰·s⁷ — direct from Phase A `norm_bch_outer_septic_remainder_le`.
- `½[R₁_sept, a']` ≤ ‖R₁_sept‖·‖a'‖ ≤ 1.875·10⁵·s⁷ (using s ≤ 1/4).
- `½[C₆(a',b), a']` ≤ ‖C₆(a',b)‖·‖a'‖ ≤ s⁶·s/2 = s⁷/2.
- `C₆(z, a') − C₆(a'+b, a')` ≤ M⁵·‖W‖ via `norm_bch_sextic_term_diff_le`,
  where M = ‖z‖+‖a'+b‖+‖a'‖ ≤ (45/11)·s and ‖W‖ ≤ (48/11)·s². Bound ≈ 5400·s⁷.

**Phase E.2: Phase B+C combined group** (~250 lines, the hard part):

LINE 2 + LINE 3 = (T₅ + T₆ + ½[C₄,a'] − correction) + (½[C₅,a'] + C₆(a',b) +
C₆(a'+b,a') + (C₅(z,a') − C₅(a'+b,a'))) — the deg-5 and deg-6 cancellation
groups from Phases B and C respectively. Each individual piece is at most
O(s⁵) or O(s⁶), so triangle inequality alone fails. Must use Phase B+C
identities to rewrite the combined sum as 3 deg-7+ residuals:

1. **T₅ residual** = `T₅ − ΔC₃_lin(V₃, x, a') − ΔC₃_quad(V₂, x, a') − T5_d6_op`
   (where T5_d6_op = ΔC₃_lin(V₄) + (1/12)·([V₂,[V₃,a']] + [V₃,[V₂,a']])).
   Algebraically: T₅ − (deg-5 ops) − (deg-6 ops) = ΔC₃_lin(V₅+V₆+R₁_sept) +
   ΔC₃_quad(V₂, V₄+V₅+V₆+R₁_sept) + ΔC₃_quad(V₄+V₅+V₆+R₁_sept, V₂) +
   ΔC₃_quad(W', W') where W' = V₃+V₄+V₅+V₆+R₁_sept. Each term ≤ K·s⁷.

2. **T₆ residual** = `T₆ − ΔC₄_lin(V₂, x, a') − T6_d6_op`
   (where T6_d6_op = ΔC₄_lin(V₃) + ΔC₄_quad(V₂)). Similar Lipschitz/quad
   structure, each term ≤ K·s⁷.

3. **C₅ diff residual** = `(C₅(z,a') − C₅(a'+b,a')) − deltaC5_lin_explicit`.
   Use `norm_bch_quintic_term_diff_le` (already proved in session 20)
   plus subtract the explicit deg-6 polynomial. The remaining residual is
   O(s⁷) by Lipschitz with ‖z − (a'+b) − V₂‖ ≤ K·s³.

Algebraic identity (LINE 2 + LINE 3 = 3 residuals) follows from Phase B
identity + Phase C identity. Bounds: each residual via triangle +
Lipschitz infrastructure.

**Phase E.3: assembly** (~100 lines):
- Triangle inequality: 13 piece bounds → ≤ K_total·s⁷.
- K_total = sum of constants ≈ 1.2·10¹⁰ + 1.5·10⁶ + 1.875·10⁵ + s⁷/2 + 5400 + 3·(K_residual). All << 10⁹.
- Replace `symmetric_bch_quintic_sub_poly_axiom` with the proven theorem.

**Required lemmas to add** (in addition to Phase E body):
- A generic commutator-norm helper: `norm_smul_half_bracket_le` (or use
  inline triangle inequalities, ~5 lines each).
- ΔC₃_lin operator bound: `‖(12)⁻¹•(...)‖ ≤ ‖V‖·‖x‖·‖y‖` (and similar for
  ΔC₃_quad, ΔC₄_lin, ΔC₄_quad). May need 4-6 helpers.

**Heartbeats**: estimated 16M-32M for the full parent theorem due to size.

**Session 20 steps 2-6** (~870 lines in `Basic.lean`): Lipschitz bounds for
`bch_cubic_term` and `bch_quintic_term` in their first argument. These are
key infrastructure for the parent T2-F7e discharge — they provide the
O(s⁴)/O(s⁶) bounds on `‖C_k(z, y) − C_k(x, y)‖` when `‖z − x‖ = O(s²)`,
needed for the "obviously O(s⁷)" piece group of the extended hdecomp.

- `BCH.norm_bch_cubic_term_diff_le`: `‖C₃(z, y) − C₃(x, y)‖ ≤
  M² · ‖z − x‖` (M = ‖z‖+‖x‖+‖y‖). 12-summand telescoping + 11-step
  triangle. ~150 lines.
- `BCH.norm_bch_quintic_group_1_diff_le` (4 words, 10 summands, 117 lines).
- `BCH.norm_bch_quintic_group_4_diff_le` (10 words, 25 summands, 188 lines;
  uses new shared `norm_5prod_le` helper).
- `BCH.norm_bch_quintic_group_6_diff_le` (14 words, 35 summands, 270 lines;
  heartbeat 1.6M for the noncomm_ring telescope identity).
- `BCH.norm_bch_quintic_group_24_diff_le` (2 words, 5 summands, 60 lines).
- `BCH.norm_bch_quintic_term_diff_le` (combines all 4 groups via
  algebraic identity + triangle, ~80 lines): `‖C₅(z, y) − C₅(x, y)‖ ≤
  M⁴ · ‖z − x‖`. With z = (a'+b)+W (‖W‖ = O(s²)): gives O(s⁶) bound,
  the deg-6+ residual estimate needed in the extended hdecomp.

**Session 20 step 7-8** (~1150 lines): `bch_sextic_term` Lipschitz bound
complete. 28 per-word lemmas (`bch_sextic_word01_diff_le` through
`bch_sextic_word28_diff_le`) + 6 position helpers (`norm_6prod_pos1_le`
through `norm_6prod_pos6_le`) + combined `norm_bch_sextic_term_diff_le`:
  `‖C₆(z, y) − C₆(x, y)‖ ≤ M⁵ · ‖z − x‖`
with K = 492/1440 = 41/120. Heartbeat 16M for whnf processing of the
28-summand `hsplit` identity.

**Lipschitz infrastructure complete**: `norm_bch_cubic_term_diff_le`,
`norm_bch_quintic_term_diff_le`, `norm_bch_sextic_term_diff_le` — all
O(M^(k-1) · ‖z−x‖) bounds. With z=(a'+b)+W (‖W‖=O(s²)): give O(s⁴),
O(s⁶), O(s⁷) bounds respectively on the C-difference pieces of the
extended hdecomp.

**Session 20 step 1**: Detailed analysis of T2-F7e parent discharge (extending
the cubic template from `Basic.lean:8601`). Produced
`claude/lean-bch-T2F7e-parent-discharge-implementation-plan.md` with:
- Complete derivation of the **extended hdecomp** (11 pieces) for
  `sym_bch_cubic - sym_E₃ - sym_E₅`.
- Concrete formulation of the 2 algebraic identities needed:
  - **Deg-5 cancellation**: `½[C₄(a',b),a'] + (deg-5 of T₅,T₆) − correction = 0`
  - **Deg-6 cancellation** (palindromic): `½[C₅(a',b),a'] + C₆(a',b)
    + C₆(a'+b,a') + (deg-6 of T₅,T₆,C₅-diff) = 0`
- Per-piece norm-bound estimates (all within 10⁵ × s⁷ budget; well under
  the 10⁹ axiom constant).
- Recommended 6-session breakdown (~1000–1500 lines total, mirrors
  the cubic template's 700-line structure but at one degree higher).

The discharge requires CAS support to compute the explicit deg-7+
residual polynomials in (a, b) for the algebraic identities; a future
session will set up this CAS pipeline (similar to the existing
`Lean-Trotter/scripts/discover_quintic_alt_form.py`).

**Session 19 final**: T2-F7e Phase A complete. The septic remainder small-s
axiom is fully discharged (~700 lines added in `Basic.lean`), reducing the
total axiom count from 3 to **2 scoped `private axiom`s**.

**Session 19 progress**: Phase A.1 (S₃' bound) + Phase A.2 (I1/I2 algebraic
identities) + Phase A.4 (I2 wrapper input helpers complete) + Phase A.5
(septic small-s discharge).

- Step 8: `y4_sub_z4_sub_y4_5_sub_y4_6_decomp` (16-term identity) +
  `norm_y4_sub_z4_sub_y4_5_sub_y4_6_le` (≤ 85·s⁷). The S₃' piece bound for
  `pieceB_septic_decomp`. Uses compound `(y²-z²)·P²` and `z·(P²-T₂²)·z`
  forms (via existing `norm_pow2_sub_zpow2_le` and `norm_P2_sub_T22_le`).
- Step 9: Level-7 exp tail lemmas — `norm_exp_sub_one_sub_sub_sub_sub_sub_sub_le`
  (noncomm) + `real_exp_seventh_order_le_septic` (real, ≤ s⁷ for s < 3/4).
  Foundation for the H_a → I_a refinement.
- Step 10: `I1_septic_residual_decomp_eq` (12-term identity, extends
  `I1_residual_decomp_eq` by subtracting `corr₁_6 = ½·W6`). Pairs the 7
  monomial parts of `½·W6` with the deg-6 leading parts of the existing
  RHS (H₁ → I_a, G₁·b → H₁·b, etc.). Proof: `match_scalars <;> ring`.
- Step 11: `I2_septic_residual_decomp_eq` (pure ring identity in
  {z, P, T₂, T₃, T₄}, extends `I2_residual_decomp_eq` by subtracting `y3_6`).
  Proof: `noncomm_ring`.
- Step 12: `norm_I1_septic_residual_RHS_le` (≤ (7 + (C₁+C₂+C₃)/2)·s⁷,
  parameterized over 3 "tricky" bounds) + `norm_I2_septic_residual_RHS_le`
  (≤ (3·K_PmT4 + 2·K_P2 + K_PzP + K_P3)·s⁷, parameterized over 4 inputs).
  Both wrappers combine precomputed bounds via triangle inequality.
- Step 13: `norm_P3_sub_T23_le` (≤ 15·s⁷ via telescope). Concrete K_P3 = 15.
- Step 14: `norm_P_sub_T2_sub_T3_sub_T4_le` (≤ 6·s⁵ via 7-term decomposition
  G₁+G₂+a·F₂+F₁·b+E₁·E₂+½·E₁·b²+½·a²·E₂). Concrete K_PmT4 = 6 input for I2.
  Algebraic identity proved via `linear_combination` from
  `R_eq_neg_deg5_residual` (avoiding the failing standalone match_scalars
  attempt: scalar mismatch in canonical form).
- Step 15: `norm_PzP_sub_T2zT2_etc_le` (≤ 13·s⁷ via 6-term decomposition
  using P=T₂+T₃+(P-T₂-T₃)). Concrete K_PzP = 13 input for I2.
- Step 16: `R_plus_T5_eq_neg_deg6_residual` — algebraic identity
  `T₃ - E₁ - E₂ - Q + T₄ + T₅ = -(H₁+H₂+a·G₂+G₁·b+E₁·E₂+½·F₁·b²+½·a²·F₂)`.
  Each RHS piece is deg-6+ in s. The deg-5 cancellation `R₅ = -T₅` exposed
  algebraically. Foundation for the future combined tricky bound.
  Proof: `linear_combination` from `R_eq_neg_deg5_residual` with
  `match_scalars + ring` for scalar normalization (12⁻¹ vs 2⁻¹·6⁻¹).
- Step 17: `norm_R_plus_T5_residual_sum_le` (≤ 6·s⁶ via 7 component bounds).
  Analog of `norm_R_residual_sum_le` at one degree higher. All inputs
  uniformly at deg-6 (no small-s constraint needed).
- Step 18: `norm_combined_tricky_le` (≤ 28·s⁷ for s ≤ 1/10). The
  combined bound for `(z·R+R·z) + T22 + T_extra`. Algebraic identity
  reduces to `z·(R+T₅) + (R+T₅)·z - P²_deg≥7`, where P²_deg≥7 is the
  10-term decomposition `T₃T₄ + T₄T₃ + T₂·D₅ + D₅·T₂ + T₄² + T₃·D₅ + D₅·T₃ + T₄·D₅ + D₅·T₄ + D₅²`
  using D₅ = P-T₂-T₃-T₄ (≤ 6·s⁵). Maxheartbeats 4M for nlinarith.
- Step 19: I1 wrapper redesign — `norm_I1_septic_residual_RHS_le` now
  takes a single combined parameter `‖z·R+R·z+T22+T_extra‖ ≤ C·s⁷`
  instead of 3 (which were unsatisfiable as constants). Result bound:
  (7 + C/2)·s⁷. With C=28 from step 18: I1 RHS ≤ 21·s⁷.
  Proof uses `abel` re-association + `← smul_add` factoring.
- Step 20: `norm_T4_le` and `norm_T5_le` standalone helpers.
  - `norm_T4_le`: `‖T₄(a,b)‖ ≤ s⁴` (sum of |coefs| = 16/24 = 2/3).
  - `norm_T5_le`: `‖T₅(a,b)‖ ≤ s⁵` (sum of |coefs| = 32/120 = 4/15).
  Factor out the inline T₄/T₅ bound calculations needed for the future
  small-s septic assembly, saving ~120 lines. Note: T₂ and T₃ helpers
  cannot be standalone with `α ≤ s, β ≤ s` since their |coef| sums are
  `> 1`; they remain inline in the assembly using `s = α + β`.
- Step 21: `real_exp_sub_one_pow7_le_small`. Helper bounding
  `(Real.exp s - 1)^7 ≤ 2·s^7` for `s ≤ 1/10`. Analog of inline `hexp6`
  in the sextic discharge. Saves ~10 lines in the future pieceA bound.

**I2 wrapper inputs all in place:** K_PmT4=6, K_P2=15, K_PzP=13, K_P3=15.
Total septic I2 RHS bound: (3·6 + 2·15 + 13 + 15)·s⁷ = 76·s⁷ for s ≤ 1/10.

**I1 wrapper now satisfiable:** With C = 28 from `norm_combined_tricky_le`,
I1 RHS ≤ 21·s⁷.

**`pieceB_septic_decomp` piece bounds (used in step 22 discharge):**
- S₁' (I₁) ≤ 21·s⁷ (via I1 wrapper + combined tricky C=28: (7 + C/2)·s⁷)
- S₂' (I₂ inner) ≤ 76·s⁷; after ⅓ scaling ≤ 26·s⁷
- S₃' (y⁴ inner) ≤ 85·s⁷; after ¼ scaling ≤ 22·s⁷
- S₄' (y⁵ inner) ≤ 51·s⁷; after ⅕ scaling ≤ 11·s⁷
- S₅ (y⁶ inner) ≤ 63·s⁷; after ⅙ scaling ≤ 11·s⁷
- **Total pieceB''' ≤ 91·s⁷**; with pieceA ≤ 2·s⁷/(2-exp(s)),
  combined gives ≤ 93·s⁷/(2-exp(s)) ≤ 1000·s⁷/(2-exp(s)).

- **Step 22 (session 19): `norm_bch_septic_remainder_small_s_le`** — fully
  discharged (~700 lines, mirrors the session-16 sextic discharge structure).
  `set_option maxHeartbeats 32000000`. Key tactic insight: pieceB_septic_decomp
  unfolds let-bindings on rewrite, so hS_i_le hypotheses must be unfolded to
  match (`simp only [hy_def, hz_def, hT₂_def, ...] at hS1_le ... hS5_le`
  before triangle inequality). hS2_inner_eq's y3_6 ordering re-aligned to
  match pieceB's (T₂zT₃ + T₂T₃z + T₃zT₂ + T₃T₂z), proved via `noncomm_ring`.

**Axiom count: 1 scoped `private axiom` + Lean's 3 standard** (reduced from
2 to 1 in session 23 via the Finset.sum refactor that discharged
`norm_C5_LinResidual_polynomial_le`). T2-F7e is fully proved.
- `BCH.suzuki5_log_product_septic_at_suzukiP_axiom` — axiom 3 (septic at Suzuki p)
  in `Suzuki5Quintic.lean`. The only remaining axiom in the entire project.

(`BCH.norm_C5_LinResidual_polynomial_le` was discharged in session 23 via a
Finset.sum refactor of the polynomial; per-degree `linResTerm{N}` / `linResBound{N}`
functions + uniform per-i bound + `Finset.sum_const`. Now a proved theorem.
`BCH.norm_bch_septic_remainder_small_s_axiom` was discharged in session 19 step 22
and is now the public theorem `norm_bch_septic_remainder_small_s_le`.)

**Session 18 highlights (`match_scalars <;> ring` methodology)**:
A simple 3-line tactic sequence replaces 150+ line scalar pattern enumerations:
```
unfold <all definitions>
simp only [smul_sub, smul_add, smul_neg, smul_smul, mul_smul_comm,
  smul_mul_assoc, mul_add, add_mul, mul_sub, sub_mul, ← mul_assoc]
match_scalars <;> ring
```

Refactored proofs (all in `BCH/Basic.lean`):
- `symmetric_bch_quintic_poly_alt_form` (NEW; T2-B alt-form): 5 lines.
- `symmetric_bch_cubic_poly_alt_form`: 28 → 5 lines.
- `symmetric_bch_quartic_identity`: 56 → 5 lines.
- `quintic_pure_identity`: 50 → 4 lines.
- `sextic_pure_identity`: 80 lines (with maxHeartbeats 4 BILLION!) → ~20 lines
  (with explicit let-binding unfolds via `show <name> = <expansion> from rfl`).

Foundation work for T2-F7e:
- `bch_sextic_term` defined (NEW): 28-term explicit polynomial in {a,b}, LCM
  1440, numerators in {±1, ±4, ±6, ±24}. With c⁶ homogeneity and norm bound
  `‖Z₆(a,b)‖ ≤ s⁶`. Used as the deg-6 leading term in the sextic identity
  for the parent discharge.

This methodology generalizes to ANY pure polynomial identity in (a, b) with
rational scalar coefficients in 𝕂. Use this template first for new identities.

**Session 17–18 final state (16 working lemmas + alt-form theorem)**:
- T2-A done: CAS pipeline `Lean-Trotter/scripts/discover_quintic_alt_form.py`.
- T2-B done (session 18, FULLY PROVED — no longer axiom):
  `symmetric_bch_quintic_poly_alt_form` via `match_scalars <;> ring`.
- T2-F1 through T2-F6 done: full framework from `‖P-1‖` bounds through
  the bridge `bch∘bch = logOnePlus(P-1)` to combined framework bound.
- T2-F7-aux, T2-F7-prelim, T2-F7-prelim2, T2-F7g-coarse done: progressively
  tighter bounds (O(s²) → O(s⁵)).
- T2-F7g-tight, T2-F-equiv done: T2-F7g ⟺ parent axiom (Lean-proved both
  directions modulo small tail term).
- T2-G done: `‖correction polynomial‖ ≤ s⁵`.
- **T2-F7e is the SOLE remaining math piece**: identify deg-5 of polynomial_in_y
  as sym_E₅ algebraically. Combined with T2-F-equiv, this immediately
  discharges the parent Tier-2 axiom.

**Session 16 discharge of `norm_bch_sextic_remainder_small_s_le`** (Tier-1 small-s,
~580 lines): mirrors quintic proof's H1 + quartic_identity pattern. Bounds 4 sub-pieces
(S₁ ≤ 20·s⁶, S₂ ≤ 17·s⁶, S₃ ≤ 8·s⁶, S₄ ≤ 7·s⁶) via `pieceB_sextic_decomp` + helpers.
Combined with pieceA ≤ 2·s⁶/(2-exp(s)) gives 100·s⁶/(2-exp(s)).

**Key theorems** (Lean-Trotter interface):
- Axiom 1 (P1, `bch_w4Deriv_quintic_level2`): **discharged session 12** via
  `BCH.norm_suzuki5_bch_sub_smul_sub_R5_le` + bridge corollary.
- Axiom 2 (P2, `bch_w4Deriv_level3_tight`): **discharged session 8** via
  `BCH.suzuki5_log_product_quintic_tight_at_suzukiP`.
- Axiom 3 (`bch_uniform_integrated`): currently scoped axiom (session 14 added).

**Public theorems added session 16**:
- `BCH.norm_bch_sextic_remainder_le` (Tier-1 of B1.c discharge): public order-6 BCH
  remainder bound `‖LHS_sextic‖ ≤ 100000·s⁶/(2-exp(s))`. Uses
  `norm_bch_sextic_remainder_large_s_le` (proved) for s ≥ 1/10 and the small-s axiom
  for s < 1/10.

## Goal

Formalize BCH and its truncated bounds in a complete normed algebra, with
applications to product formula error analysis (Trotter, Strang, Suzuki).

## Constraints

- **Lean:** 4.29.0-rc8 (via `lean-toolchain`)
- **Mathlib:** pinned in `lake-manifest.json`
- **Typeclass setup:** `[NormedRing 𝔸] [NormedAlgebra 𝕂 𝔸] [NormOneClass 𝔸] [CompleteSpace 𝔸]`
- `include 𝕂 in` needed before theorems where `𝕂` appears in proofs but not the type.

## Key Techniques

### Non-commutative scalar issue
`(2:𝕂)⁻¹ • x` (scalar smul) doesn't interact with `noncomm_ring` or `abel`.
**Solution:** Multiply both sides by `(2:𝕂)`, clear via `smul_smul` +
`inv_mul_cancel₀` + `one_smul`, then use `noncomm_ring` on the scalar-free
identity. Pattern: `apply hinj_N; simp only [smul_zero]; ...; noncomm_ring`.

### `dsimp only` BEFORE scalar clearing
Unfolds let-bindings transparently so `noncomm_ring` sees daggered (have-bound)
variables as proper atoms. Without it, the proof fails. Used in
`I1_residual_decomp_eq`, `sextic_pure_identity`, and similar.

### Algebraic identity templates (`quartic_identity` pattern)
Identities like `½W + ⅓z³ - C₃ = (deg-4+ residual)` proved via:
1. Sub-identity `hpure` (pure a, b) by ×LCM scalar clearing + `noncomm_ring`.
2. Full identity by ×LCM + `simp only [smul_smul, ...]` + `noncomm_ring`.

### Critical lesson: post-substitution decomposition
Pure {a, b, ea, eb} ring identities for the **deg-5** cancellation in
`bch_quintic_term` do NOT exist (verified by CAS — bbbba/bbbbA coupling).
The decomposition works only on SUBSTITUTED polynomials in {a, b}.
`sextic_pure_identity` exploits this.

### Tactics for non-comm + smul
- `linear_combination (norm := module)` works for `pieceB_sextic_decomp` (with
  let-bindings) but is unreliable in general; the underlying `module` calls
  `ring` which fails on non-comm products. **Workaround**: use scalar clearing
  + `noncomm_ring`, or `convert` + `abel` for term reordering.
- `noncomm_ring` doesn't handle `smul`; combine with `simp [smul_sub, smul_add,
  smul_mul_assoc, mul_smul_comm]` to distribute first.

### `match_scalars <;> ring` for poly identities in 𝕂-modules (NEW session 18)
For polynomial identities (over `NormedAlgebra 𝕂 𝔸`) with rational scalar
coefficients in 𝕂, the cleanest proof is:
```lean
unfold <all definitions>
simp only [smul_sub, smul_add, smul_neg, smul_smul, mul_smul_comm,
  smul_mul_assoc, mul_add, add_mul, mul_sub, sub_mul, ← mul_assoc]
match_scalars <;> ring
```

Why each part:
- `smul_*` lemmas distribute scalar multiplication through algebraic ops.
- `mul_smul_comm`, `smul_mul_assoc` pull smul out of products.
- `mul_*` and `*_mul` distribute multiplication.
- `← mul_assoc` left-associates products (so `match_scalars` sees `a*b*c`
  consistently as `(a*b)*c`, otherwise it produces non-trivial scalar goals).
- `match_scalars` splits the equation into one scalar identity per monomial.
- `ring` (commutative 𝕂-arithmetic) closes each scalar goal.

For identities with `let` bindings (e.g., `let z := a + b in ...`), unfold the
let bindings explicitly first via `simp only [show <name> = <expansion> from rfl]`,
since `match_scalars` doesn't auto-unfold them.

Refactored: cubic alt-form, quartic identity, quintic_pure_identity,
sextic_pure_identity (sessions 18). Original proofs used ×LCM + comprehensive
pattern enumeration (50-200 lines each); new proofs are 4-20 lines.

### `convert` pattern for QPI/SPI applications
`convert quintic_pure_identity 𝕂 a b using 2 <;> simp [hz_def] <;> ring` —
matches a goal that differs from QPI by simple substitution + scalar reduction.
Used in the quintic proof's `hQPI` (line ~3258).

### Splitting monolithic noncomm_ring proofs
A 128-monomial `noncomm_ring` may time out at 1.6M heartbeats. Splitting into
two 64-monomial half-identities makes it tractable. Used for
`comm_V_V_symmetric_bch_cubic_poly_eq_childs_basis` (B2.2.e).

### Per-term `private lemma`s for polynomial bookkeeping
For deeply nested polynomial expressions (P1 discharge, ~1100 lines), splitting
into per-term private lemmas avoids kernel whnf blowup. Final combination via
`le_trans` (not `linarith`) sidesteps def-unfolding arithmetic.

## Tier-1 of B1.c: `norm_bch_sextic_remainder_le`

Status: public theorem in place using `norm_bch_sextic_remainder_small_s_le` axiom.

### Proven (sessions 13-15, in `Basic.lean`)

- `bch_quintic_term`, `real_exp_sixth_order_le_sextic`,
  `norm_logOnePlus_sub_sub_sub_sub_sub_le` (order-6 log/exp tail bounds).
- `sextic_pure_identity`: deg-5 cancellation `½W5 + ⅓y3_5 - ¼y4_5 + ⅕z⁵ - C₅ = 0`
  on substituted polynomials in {a, b}. ×720 + `noncomm_ring`,
  `maxHeartbeats 4000000000`.
- `pieceB_sextic_decomp`: central decomposition pieceB'' = S₁+S₂-S₃+S₄ via
  `linear_combination (norm := module) hQPI + hSPI`.
- `I1_residual_decomp_eq` + `R_eq_neg_deg5_residual` (algebraic identities).
- Per-term norm bounds:
  - `norm_I1_residual_RHS_le` (≤ 20·s⁶ for S₁)
  - `norm_I2_residual_inner_le` (≤ 50·s⁶, ÷3 for S₂ → ≤17·s⁶)
  - `norm_y4_sub_z4_sub_y4_5_le` (≤ 31·s⁶, ÷4 for S₃ → ≤8·s⁶)
  - `norm_pow5_sub_zpow5_le` (≤ 31·s⁶, ÷5 for S₄ → ≤7·s⁶)
- Component bounds: `norm_R_residual_sum_le`, `norm_T22_sub_P2_etc_le`,
  `norm_P_sub_T2_sub_T3_le`, `norm_PzP_sub_T2zT2_le`, `norm_P2_sub_T22_le`.
- `norm_bch_sextic_remainder_large_s_le` (s ≥ 1/10 case, fully proved).

### Remaining (Task #17b: discharge `norm_bch_sextic_remainder_small_s_le`)

~250-300 lines. Must combine pieceA bound (via
`norm_logOnePlus_sub_sub_sub_sub_sub_le`) with pieceB'' = 4 sub-pieces
(via `pieceB_sextic_decomp`).

**Key Lean-tactic challenges**:
- T₃_QPI (= ⅙a³+⅙b³+½ab²+½a²b) and T₃_SPI (= ⅙a³+½a²b+½ab²+⅙b³) are
  equal as values but differ syntactically; QPI uses the former, SPI the
  latter. `pieceB_sextic_decomp` separates them via separate let-bindings.
- The S₁ bound requires the H1 + quartic_identity + I1_residual_decomp_eq
  chain; mirror the quintic proof's `hH1` + `hI₁_quartic` pattern (lines
  3208 and 3239 of `Basic.lean`).
- Avoid `linear_combination (norm := module)` for the per-piece equalities
  (it's flaky for non-comm + smul); use `convert` + `abel` for reordering,
  or scalar clearing + `noncomm_ring`.

See `claude/sextic_remainder_strategy.md` for the full proof plan and
per-piece bounds.

## Tier-2 of B1.c: `symmetric_bch_quintic_sub_poly_axiom`

Asserts for `‖a‖+‖b‖ < 1/4`:
```
‖symmetric_bch_cubic 𝕂 a b − symmetric_bch_cubic_poly 𝕂 a b
    − symmetric_bch_quintic_poly 𝕂 a b‖ ≤ 10⁹ · (‖a‖+‖b‖)⁷
```

Public theorems depending on this axiom:
- `BCH.norm_symmetric_bch_quintic_sub_poly_le` (B1.c bridge).
- `BCH.norm_strangBlock_log_sub_quintic_target_le` (B1.d per-block wrapper).

CAS at `Lean-Trotter/scripts/verify_strangblock_degree7.py` confirms degrees
2, 4, 6 vanish identically (palindromic symmetry); degree-7 residual has
126 non-zero `{a,b}`-words.

### Decomposition into sub-tasks T2-A through T2-G

**Session 17–18 progress** (13+ commits, 16 working lemmas):
- ✅ T2-A: CAS `Lean-Trotter/scripts/discover_quintic_alt_form.py` discovers
  the explicit alt-form decomposition (residual = 0). Outputs the combined
  correction polynomial (25 terms, denom 11520).
- ✅ T2-B (session 18): `BCH.symmetric_bch_quintic_poly_alt_form` is now a
  fully proved theorem (3-line proof via `match_scalars <;> ring` after
  unfolding + smul distribution). The 25-term `correction_poly` is defined
  in `SymmetricQuintic.lean`.
- ✅ T2-F7e infrastructure step 1 (session 18): `BCH.bch_sextic_term` defined
  + `bch_sextic_term_smul` (homogeneity) + `norm_bch_sextic_term_le`
  (`‖Z₆(a,b)‖ ≤ s⁶`). 28-term explicit polynomial in {a,b}, LCM 1440,
  numerators in {±1, ±4, ±6, ±24}. Used as the deg-6 leading term in the
  sextic identity for the parent discharge.
- ✅ T2-F7e infrastructure step 2 (session 18): `BCH.septic_pure_identity`
  — the deg-6 cancellation algebraic identity (analog of `sextic_pure_identity`
  at one higher degree). Asserts:
  `½·W6 + ⅓·y3_6 - ¼·y4_6 + ⅕·y5_6 - ⅙·z⁶ - bch_sextic_term = 0`
  where W6, y3_6, y4_6, y5_6 capture deg-6 contributions from y, y², y³, y⁴, y⁵.
  Pure {a, b} polynomial identity, proved via `match_scalars <;> ring`
  (only 16M heartbeats, vs 4 BILLION for the original sextic_pure_identity).
- ✅ T2-F7e infrastructure step 3 (session 18):
  `BCH.norm_bch_septic_remainder_large_s_le` — the easy half of the order-7
  BCH remainder bound, for s ≥ 1/10. Proved via triangle inequality from
  `norm_bch_sextic_remainder_le` + `norm_bch_sextic_term_le`. Bound:
  `‖LHS_septic‖ ≤ 1000010·s⁷/(2-exp(s))`.
- ✅ T2-F7e infrastructure step 4 (session 18):
  `BCH.norm_bch_septic_remainder_le` — public theorem combining the
  large-s case (proved) with a small-s axiom
  (`norm_bch_septic_remainder_small_s_axiom`). The small-s axiom is a
  stepping stone (analog of the discharged session-16 sextic small-s
  axiom; can be discharged similarly using septic_pure_identity).
- ✅ T2-F7e infrastructure step 5 (session 18, pow6 helper):
  `BCH.pow6_sub_zpow6_telescope` (6-fold non-commutative telescoping)
  + `BCH.norm_pow6_sub_zpow6_le` (`‖y⁶ - z⁶‖ ≤ 63·s⁷` for `‖y‖ ≤ 2s,
  ‖z‖ ≤ s, ‖P‖ ≤ s²`). Building block analog of `pow5_sub_zpow5_telescope`
  + `norm_pow5_sub_zpow5_le` for the future `norm_bch_septic_remainder_small_s_le`
  (S₅ piece bound: `⅙·63·s⁷ ≈ 10.5·s⁷`).
- ✅ T2-F7e infrastructure step 6 (session 18, pow4 + y5 helpers):
  `BCH.norm_pow4_sub_zpow4_le` (`‖y⁴ - z⁴‖ ≤ 15·s⁵`),
  `BCH.y5_sub_z5_sub_y5_6_decomp` (algebraic identity, 9 deg-7+ terms),
  `BCH.norm_y5_sub_z5_sub_y5_6_le` (`‖y⁵ - z⁵ - y5_6‖ ≤ 51·s⁷`).
  Analog of `norm_y4_sub_z4_sub_y4_5_le` at one degree higher; needed for
  the S₄' piece of `pieceB_septic_decomp`.
- ✅ T2-F7e infrastructure step 7 (session 18, **pieceB_septic_decomp**):
  `BCH.pieceB_septic_decomp` — the CENTRAL algebraic decomposition for
  the septic small-s case. Analog of `pieceB_sextic_decomp` at one degree
  higher. States:
  ```
  pieceB''' = (I₁ - corr₁ - corr₁_5 - corr₁_6) +
              (I₂ - corr₂ - corr₂_5 - corr₂_6) -
              ¼(y⁴-z⁴-y4_5-y4_6) + ⅕(y⁵-z⁵-y5_6) - ⅙(y⁶-z⁶)
  ```
  Where corr₁_6 = ½·W6, corr₂_6 = ⅓·y3_6, y4_6/y5_6/y3_6 are the explicit
  deg-6 contributions to y⁴/y⁵/y³.
  **Proof: 5 lines** — `linear_combination (norm := module) hQPI + hSPI + hSeptic`.
  Each piece on the RHS has deg-7+ structure.

  This is the foundation for the future small-s septic discharge.
  Remaining pieces: norm bounds for S₁', S₂', S₃' (S₄' and S₅ already done).
- ✅ T2-F1: `norm_three_factor_exp_product_sub_one_le` —
  `‖P-1‖ ≤ exp(s)-1` (Palindromic.lean).

- ✅ T2-F5: `norm_logOnePlus_strangBlock_sub_through_deg_6_le` — deg-7 tail
  bound on `logOnePlus(P-1)` in terms of `s` (Palindromic.lean).

  `norm_mul_exp_sub_one_sub_le` (deg-2 chain step).
- ✅ T2-F7-prelim: `norm_polynomial_in_y_sub_add_le` — coarse O(s²) bound
  on the deg-2+ residual of polynomial_in_y after subtracting (a+b). Sums
  per-term ‖y^k/k‖ bounds via triangle inequality.
- ✅ T2-F7-prelim2: `norm_polynomial_in_y_sub_add_sub_E3_le` — tighter

  T2-F6 framework via triangle inequality.
- ✅ T2-F7g-coarse: `norm_polynomial_in_y_sub_add_sub_E3_sub_E5_le` —
  coarse O(s⁵) version of the final T2-F7g target after subtracting also

  Sum of |numerators|/11520 = 1360/11520 ≈ 0.118 < 1.

**Pending sub-tasks**:

**T2-C** (revised): `symmetric_bch_sextic_part_zero` — assert that the
deg-6 part of `sym_bch_cubic - sym_E₃ - sym_E₅` equals zero (palindromic
vanishing of even degrees in the 3-factor product).

**T2-D** (revised): Extended `hdecomp`. The natural per-piece
decomposition (R₁_sextic, R₂_sextic, 7 terms) gives only O(s⁶) per term.
**This decomposition cannot achieve O(s⁷) by itself.**

**T2-E** (revised): **Critical reassessment after session 17 analysis**:
For `s ≤ 1/4`, an O(s⁶) per-piece bound CANNOT imply O(s⁷): the
relationship is `s⁶ > s⁷` for `s < 1`. Achieving O(s⁷) requires exploiting
the palindromic deg-6 cancellation algebraically.

**Revised discharge strategy** (replaces the per-piece T2-C/D/E approach):

Treat `sym_bch_cubic - sym_E₃ - sym_E₅` directly as the deg-7+ tail of
`log(exp(½a)·exp(b)·exp(½a))`. Bound this tail via a series convergence
argument analogous to `norm_bch_quintic_remainder_le` (Basic.lean:2873,
~750 lines).

Specifically, write the 3-factor Strang product as:
```
P(a, b) := exp(½a) · exp(b) · exp(½a)
log(P) = (a+b) + sym_E₃(a, b) + sym_E₅(a, b) + sym_E₇(a, b) + ...
       (palindromic: deg 2, 4, 6 vanish identically)
```

The bound `‖log(P) - through-deg-5‖ ≤ K · s⁷ / (constant)` follows from:
1. P - 1 has tail bounded by `(exp(s/2)·exp(s)·exp(s/2)) - 1 - (deg≤6 sum)`.
2. log(1+y) tail bounded by `‖y‖^7 · series tail`.
3. Combine with explicit identification of deg-1, deg-3, deg-5 contributions
   (the latter via the just-discharged alt-form lemma).

**Estimated size**: ~1000-1500 lines (mirrors the structure of
`norm_bch_quintic_remainder_le`, but for the 3-factor symmetric product).

**Per-piece decomposition (T2-C/D/E original) is REJECTED** as a path —
fundamentally cannot reach O(s⁷) without the full Tier-1 sextic
infrastructure (additional ~1500 lines for `bch_sextic_term` +
`norm_bch_septic_remainder_le`).

**Recommendation for next session**: Discharge T2-F7e via Option B
(extending the cubic template `norm_symmetric_bch_cubic_sub_poly_le` at
`Basic.lean:5834`). The recommended structure:

1. **Inner BCH expansion to deg-5**: define
   `inner_R₆ := z - (a'+b) - ½[a',b] - C₃(a',b) - C₄(a',b) - bqt(a',b)`
   (the deg-6+ remainder after subtracting the explicit deg-5 contribution).
   Bound: `‖inner_R₆‖ ≤ K · s⁶` via `norm_bch_sextic_remainder_le`.
2. **Outer BCH expansion to deg-5**: similarly define `outer_R₆`.
3. **Sextic identity**: an algebraic identity (analog of
   `symmetric_bch_quartic_identity` at `Basic.lean:5760`) showing that
   the sum of all deg-6 contributions to `sym_bch_cubic - sym_E₃ - sym_E₅`
   equals zero. **Try `match_scalars <;> ring` first** — same technique as
   the alt-form discharge.
4. **Extended hdecomp**: rewrite `sym_bch_cubic - sym_E₃ - sym_E₅` as a
   sum of ~7 pieces, each O(s⁷) using the sextic identity for deg-6
   cancellation.
5. **Per-piece bounds**: each new term needs O(s⁷) constant.

**Estimated size**: ~1000-1500 lines total, but possibly less if
`match_scalars` works for the sextic identity.

The alt-form discharge (T2-B) is now in place to support step 4
(absorbing the deg-5 contribution from `bqt(a', b) + bqt(a'+b, a')`).

## Lean-Trotter interface (axioms 1–3)

`Lean-Trotter/LieTrotter/Suzuki4ViaBCH.lean` has three BCH-interface axioms:

1. `bch_w4Deriv_quintic_level2` — unit-coefficient pointwise τ⁵ bound.
   **Discharged session 12** via `BCH.norm_suzuki5_bch_sub_smul_sub_R5_le`.
2. `bch_w4Deriv_level3_tight` — tight γᵢ at Suzuki p.
   **Discharged session 8** via `BCH.suzuki5_log_product_quintic_tight_at_suzukiP`.
3. `bch_uniform_integrated` — order-7 + R₇ + FTC-2 integrated bound.
   Currently `BCH.suzuki5_log_product_septic_at_suzukiP_axiom` (Lean-BCH side).

**Key public theorems on this branch** (depend only on Lean's 3 standard +
B1.c Tier-2 axiom + `suzuki5_log_product_septic_at_suzukiP_axiom`):
- `BCH.norm_suzuki5_bch_sub_smul_sub_R5_le` (P1 headline).
- `BCH.suzuki5_log_product_quintic_of_IsSuzukiCubic` (P1 bridge corollary).
- `BCH.suzuki5_log_product_quintic_tight_at_suzukiP` (P2 bridge).
- `BCH.norm_bch_sextic_remainder_le` (Tier-1 of B1.c, fully proven
  session 16).
- `BCH.norm_bch_septic_remainder_le` (T2-F7e infra step 4, **fully proven**
  session 19; no longer depends on a small-s axiom — `Basic.lean` has 0
  remaining axioms).
