# BCH/SymmetricQuintic — τ⁵ coefficient of the 3-factor symmetric BCH

Provides the degree-5 polynomial form `symmetric_bch_quintic_poly a b` for
the τ⁵ Taylor coefficient of `log(exp(a/2)·exp(b)·exp(a/2))`, plus its
`c⁵` homogeneity.

This mirrors the existing `symmetric_bch_cubic_poly` in `Basic.lean` and
is the Tier-1 infrastructure piece (definition + homogeneity) for
discharging Lean-BCH's `suzuki5_R5_identification_axiom`.

## Status (Option 1 scope, partial)

**Done this session:**
- `symmetric_bch_quintic_poly a b` — 30-term explicit polynomial form,
  CAS-derived from `Lean-Trotter/scripts/compute_bch_prefactors.py`.
  Rational coefficients with common denominator 5760 (integer
  numerators in `{7, ±7, 42, 72, 12, 32, ±28, ±48, ±8, 192}`).
- `symmetric_bch_quintic_poly_smul` — `c⁵` scaling homogeneity.
  Provable by `simp` on the 5-fold-smul-mul helper.

**Deferred to a follow-up session:**
- `norm_symmetric_bch_quintic_poly_le` — `‖E₅(a, b)‖ ≤ (‖a‖+‖b‖)⁵`.
  Straightforward in principle (30-way triangle inequality + word
  norm ≤ s⁵ + Σ |coef|/5760 = 1216/5760 < 1), but the 29-step
  `norm_add_le` chain is verbose (~50 lines). Not blocking downstream
  development — the definition is fully specified and downstream
  proofs can use pointwise per-term bounds until the global bound lands.
- Full Taylor expansion theorem

      ∃ δ > 0, ∃ K ≥ 0, ∀ τ, ‖τ‖ < δ →
        ‖symmetric_bch(c·τ·a, c·τ·b) − (c·τ)•(a+b)
           − (c·τ)³•symmetric_bch_cubic_poly a b
           − (c·τ)⁵•symmetric_bch_quintic_poly a b‖ ≤ K·‖c·τ‖⁷·(‖a‖+‖b‖)⁷

  requires a degree-5+ symbolic BCH expansion machinery (extend H1/H2's
  cubic/quartic to quintic). This is the B1.c piece of the session-9+
  roadmap for discharging `suzuki5_R5_identification_axiom`.

## The 30-term τ⁵ polynomial

CAS-derived from
`Lean-Trotter/scripts/compute_bch_prefactors.py::strang_block_series`
at degree 5. Each of the 30 non-zero 5-letter words `x₁x₂x₃x₄x₅` with
`xᵢ ∈ {a, b}` has a rational coefficient with common denominator 5760.

Palindromic symmetry: `coef(w) = coef(reverse(w))` — 12 word/reverse
pairs plus 6 self-palindromic words (AABAA, ABABA, ABBBA, BAAAB,
BABAB, BBABB).

/-- **τ⁵ coefficient of `log(exp(a/2)·exp(b)·exp(a/2))`** — explicit
30-term polynomial form.

The coefficients are rational with LCM 5760; written individually here.
This is the 3-factor Strang block's quintic BCH coefficient, analogous
to `symmetric_bch_cubic_poly` for the cubic coefficient.

For any `c : 𝕂`, `symmetric_bch_quintic_poly(c•a, c•b) = c⁵ •

homogeneous of degree 5 in `(a, b)`.

## Norm bound: `‖E₅(a, b)‖ ≤ (‖a‖ + ‖b‖)⁵`

Proof strategy: each 5-letter word has norm ≤ `s⁵` where
`s = ‖a‖ + ‖b‖`; the sum of `|coef|·5760` over the 30 terms is
`1216 ≤ 5760`, giving total `‖E₅‖ ≤ (1216/5760)·s⁵ ≤ s⁵`.

/-- **Norm bound for `symmetric_bch_quintic_poly`**:
`‖E₅(a, b)‖ ≤ (‖a‖ + ‖b‖)⁵`.

Proof: each of the 30 terms is bounded by `|coef|·s⁵` via
`norm_scaled_word_le`; the 30 integer numerators `|k|` sum to 1216
(< 5760), so the triangle-inequality chain yields the `s⁵` bound.
