# BCH/SymmetricQuintic — τ⁵ coefficient of the 3-factor symmetric BCH

Provides the degree-5 polynomial form `symmetric_bch_quintic_poly a b` for
the τ⁵ Taylor coefficient of `log(exp(a/2)·exp(b)·exp(a/2))`, plus its
`c⁵` homogeneity.

This mirrors the existing `symmetric_bch_cubic_poly` in `Basic.lean` and
is the Tier-1 infrastructure piece (definition + homogeneity) for
discharging Lean-BCH's `suzuki5_R5_identification_axiom`.

## Status (Option 1 scope, partial)

**Done this session:**
- `symmetric_bch_quintic_poly a b` — 30-term explicit polynomial form,
  CAS-derived from `Lean-Trotter/scripts/compute_bch_prefactors.py`.
  Rational coefficients with common denominator 5760 (integer
  numerators in `{7, ±7, 42, 72, 12, 32, ±28, ±48, ±8, 192}`).
- `symmetric_bch_quintic_poly_smul` — `c⁵` scaling homogeneity.
  Provable by `simp` on the 5-fold-smul-mul helper.

**Deferred to a follow-up session:**
- `norm_symmetric_bch_quintic_poly_le` — `‖E₅(a, b)‖ ≤ (‖a‖+‖b‖)⁵`.
  Straightforward in principle (30-way triangle inequality + word
  norm ≤ s⁵ + Σ |coef|/5760 = 1216/5760 < 1), but the 29-step
  `norm_add_le` chain is verbose (~50 lines). Not blocking downstream
  development — the definition is fully specified and downstream
  proofs can use pointwise per-term bounds until the global bound lands.
- Full Taylor expansion theorem

      ∃ δ > 0, ∃ K ≥ 0, ∀ τ, ‖τ‖ < δ →
        ‖symmetric_bch(c·τ·a, c·τ·b) − (c·τ)•(a+b)
           − (c·τ)³•symmetric_bch_cubic_poly a b
           − (c·τ)⁵•symmetric_bch_quintic_poly a b‖ ≤ K·‖c·τ‖⁷·(‖a‖+‖b‖)⁷

  requires a degree-5+ symbolic BCH expansion machinery (extend H1/H2's
  cubic/quartic to quintic). This is the B1.c piece of the session-9+
  roadmap for discharging `suzuki5_R5_identification_axiom`.

## The 30-term τ⁵ polynomial

CAS-derived from
`Lean-Trotter/scripts/compute_bch_prefactors.py::strang_block_series`
at degree 5. Each of the 30 non-zero 5-letter words `x₁x₂x₃x₄x₅` with
`xᵢ ∈ {a, b}` has a rational coefficient with common denominator 5760.

Palindromic symmetry: `coef(w) = coef(reverse(w))` — 12 word/reverse
pairs plus 6 self-palindromic words (AABAA, ABABA, ABBBA, BAAAB,
BABAB, BBABB).

/-- **τ⁵ coefficient of `log(exp(a/2)·exp(b)·exp(a/2))`** — explicit
30-term polynomial form.

The coefficients are rational with LCM 5760; written individually here.
This is the 3-factor Strang block's quintic BCH coefficient, analogous
to `symmetric_bch_cubic_poly` for the cubic coefficient.

For any `c : 𝕂`, `symmetric_bch_quintic_poly(c•a, c•b) = c⁵ •

homogeneous of degree 5 in `(a, b)`.

## Norm bound: `‖E₅(a, b)‖ ≤ (‖a‖ + ‖b‖)⁵`

Proof strategy: each 5-letter word has norm ≤ `s⁵` where
`s = ‖a‖ + ‖b‖`; the sum of `|coef|·5760` over the 30 terms is
`1216 ≤ 5760`, giving total `‖E₅‖ ≤ (1216/5760)·s⁵ ≤ s⁵`.

/-- **Norm bound for `symmetric_bch_quintic_poly`**:
`‖E₅(a, b)‖ ≤ (‖a‖ + ‖b‖)⁵`.

Proof: each of the 30 terms is bounded by `|coef|·s⁵` via
`norm_scaled_word_le`; the 30 integer numerators `|k|` sum to 1216
(< 5760), so the triangle-inequality chain yields the `s⁵` bound.

## Vanishing on `(α•V, β•V)` (B2.2.a)

`symmetric_bch_quintic_poly` evaluated at scalar multiples of a single element
`V : 𝔸` is identically zero:

  `E₅(α•V, β•V) = 0`  for any  `α, β : 𝕂, V : 𝔸`.

This is a structural property: each 5-letter word `x₁x₂x₃x₄x₅` (with each
`xᵢ ∈ {α•V, β•V}`) evaluates to `(α^k · β^(5−k)) • V⁵` where `k` is the number
of `α`-slots. Summing the 30 word coefficients per `k`-group gives identically
zero polynomials in `(α, β)`:

* `k = 4` (5 words `xxxxy` with one `b`):  `7 − 28 + 42 − 28 + 7 = 0`
* `k = 3` (10 words):  `−28 + 72 + 12 − 48 − 48 + 12 + 32 − 48 + 72 − 28 = 0`
* `k = 2` (10 words):  `32 − 48 − 48 + 32 − 48 + 192 − 48 − 48 − 48 + 32 = 0`
* `k = 1` (5 words `xyyyy` with one `a`):  `−8 + 32 − 48 + 32 − 8 = 0`
* `k = 0, 5`:  no terms in the polynomial (no `aaaaa` or `bbbbb` words).

This is the **foundation lemma for B2.2**: when expanding
`sym_quintic_poly(4X, Y)` with `X = (pτ)•V + R_X` and `Y = ((1−4p)τ)•V + R_Y`,
the leading "all-V-linear" τ⁵ contribution vanishes, leaving only "≥1
residual" cross-terms which sit at `O(τ⁷)` (since each residual is `O(τ³)`).

**Why this matters**: in the τ⁵ identification of `suzuki5_R5`, the
`sym_quintic_poly(4X, Y)` contribution turns out to be `O(τ⁷)` — i.e., it
doesn't contribute at τ⁵ — so the entire τ⁵ residue comes from
`sym_cubic_poly(4X, Y)` plus the per-block quintic `(4p⁵+(1−4p)⁵)·E₅_sym`. -/

/-! ### B2.2.c — Lipschitz bound on (α•V + δa, β•V + δb) inputs

When the inputs are perturbations `(α•V + δa, β•V + δb)` of scalar multiples,
the symmetric quintic polynomial is bounded by `2·N⁴·(‖δa‖+‖δb‖)` rather than
the trivial `(‖α•V+δa‖+‖β•V+δb‖)⁵`. The structural vanishing on scalar•V inputs
(B2.2.a) is the source of the `δ`-linear factor; combined with the 5-letter
Lipschitz bound (`word_5_diff_le`), this gives a "linear in residual" bound.

For the Suzuki τ⁵ identification, this means `‖sym_quintic_poly(4X, Y)‖ = O(τ⁷)`
when `X, Y` have linear part `O(τ)` plus residual `O(τ³)`. -/

/-- **B2.2.c**: Lipschitz bound for `symmetric_bch_quintic_poly` on inputs of the
form `(α • V + δa, β • V + δb)`.

Combined with B2.2.a's vanishing on scalar•V inputs, the bound is
`O(N⁴ · (‖δa‖+‖δb‖))` rather than the trivial `(‖α•V+δa‖+‖β•V+δb‖)⁵`.

**Why this matters**: in the τ⁵ identification of `suzuki5_R5`, the inputs to
`symmetric_bch_quintic_poly` are `4X` and `Y` where `X = pτ•A + (residual O(τ³))`.
Setting `α = 4·p·τ`, `V = A`, and treating the residuals as `δa, δb = O(τ³)`,
the bound becomes `O(N⁴ · τ³)` where `N = O(τ)`, i.e., `O(τ⁷)` — gaining 2 orders
of `τ` over the trivial bound. The structural vanishing on `V`-only inputs is the
source of the extra factor of `τ²`.

Proof: B2.2.a gives `sym_quintic_poly(α•V, β•V) = 0`, so
`sym_quintic_poly(α•V+δa, β•V+δb) = sym_quintic_poly(α•V+δa, β•V+δb) - sym_quintic_poly(α•V, β•V)`.
The diff regroups into 30 paired smul-diff terms `cᵢ•(full_word - lin_word)`, each
bounded by `|cᵢ|/5760 · 5·(N⁴·D)` via `word_5_diff_le`. Summing gives `1216·5/5760·N⁴·D

## Alt-form decomposition of `symmetric_bch_quintic_poly`

CAS-derived (`Lean-Trotter/scripts/discover_quintic_alt_form.py`):

    sym_E₅(a, b) = bch_quintic_term(½a, b)
                 + bch_quintic_term(½a + b, ½a)
                 + symmetric_bch_quintic_correction_poly(a, b)

The correction polynomial is a 25-term degree-5 polynomial in `{a, b}` with
common denominator `11520` and integer numerators in
`{±15, ±20, ±30, ±40, ±50, ±60, ±90, ±110, ±160}`. It captures the three
remaining contributions:
- `½·[bch_quartic_term(½a, b), ½a]` (degree-5 from ½[z, ½a])
- `(C₃(z, ½a) − C₃(½a+b, ½a))_d5` (linear-in-z_d3 + bilinear-in-z_d2)
- `(C₄(z, ½a) − C₄(½a+b, ½a))_d5` (linear-in-z_d3 + linear-in-z_d2)

This is the analog of `symmetric_bch_cubic_poly_alt_form` (Basic.lean) at
one degree higher, and is the key infrastructure for discharging the B1.c
Tier-2 axiom `symmetric_bch_quintic_sub_poly_axiom`.

/-- **Norm bound for `symmetric_bch_quintic_correction_poly`** (T2-G):
`‖correction(a, b)‖ ≤ (‖a‖+‖b‖)⁵`.

CAS: sum of |numerators| over the 25 terms = 1360. So sum of bounds is
1360/11520 · s⁵ ≈ 0.118 · s⁵ ≤ s⁵.

The proof uses the auxiliary `norm_correction_word_le_helper` and standard
triangle inequality, integer-cast bridge for each of the 25 terms. -/

/-- **Alt-form decomposition of `symmetric_bch_quintic_poly`** (T2-B, Tier-2
stepping stone — now fully proved):

    sym_E₅(a, b) = bch_quintic_term(½a, b)
                 + bch_quintic_term(½a + b, ½a)
                 + symmetric_bch_quintic_correction_poly(a, b)

CAS-derived and CAS-verified (`Lean-Trotter/scripts/discover_quintic_alt_form.py`
confirms the decomposition is exact: residual = 0 across all 30 5-letter words).

This is a pure polynomial identity in `{a, b}`. Discharged session 18 via:
1. `unfold` all definitions on both sides.
2. `simp only [smul_sub, smul_add, smul_neg, smul_smul, mul_smul_comm,
    smul_mul_assoc, mul_add, add_mul]` to fully distribute scalars and
    products through the polynomial expressions.
3. `match_scalars` reduces to a sequence of scalar identities (one per
    {a,b}-word in the basis).
4. `ring` (commutative `𝕂`-arithmetic) closes each scalar goal.

Earlier sessions attempted `×LCM + comprehensive pattern enumeration +
noncomm_ring`, which required ~150-200 lines and failed due to simp's
associativity normalization not matching all enumerated patterns.
`match_scalars <;> ring` sidesteps that issue by working at the module level. -/

/-- **Deg-5 cancellation pure identity** (T2-F7e Phase B, stepping-stone axiom).

For the parent discharge of the τ⁵ symmetric-BCH bridge, the deg-5 piece group
in the extended hdecomp `T₅ + T₆ + ½·[C₄(a',b), a'] − correction` has its
deg-5 part cancel as an algebraic identity in `𝕂⟨a, b⟩`.

Specifically, with `a' := ½a`, `V₂ := ½·[a',b]`, `V₃ := C₃(a',b)`, `x := a'+b`:

  ΔC₃_lin(V₃, x, a') + ΔC₃_quad(V₂, x, a')           -- = (deg-5 of T₅)
+ ΔC₄_lin(V₂, x, a')                                  -- = (deg-5 of T₆)
+ ½·(C₄(a', b)·a' − a'·C₄(a', b))                    -- = ½·[C₄(a',b), a']
= symmetric_bch_quintic_correction_poly 𝕂 a b        -- = correction(a, b)

Where the perturbation operators expand as:
- `ΔC₃_lin(V, x, y)`  = (1/12)·([V,[x,y]] + [x,[V,y]] + [y,[y,V]])
- `ΔC₃_quad(V, x, y)` = (1/12)·[V,[V,y]]
- `ΔC₄_lin(V, x, y)`  = -(1/24)·([y,[x,[V,y]]] + [y,[V,[x,y]]])

**CAS-verified** at `Lean-Trotter/scripts/verify_t2f7e_deg5_cancellation.py`:
both sides reduce to the same 25-monomial polynomial in {a, b}-words with
rational coefficients (denominator 11520).

**Status (session 21, 2026-05-09)**: discharged via 4 CAS-derived sub-lemmas
(`deltaC3_lin_V3_eq`, `deltaC3_quad_V2_eq`, `deltaC4_lin_V2_eq`, `half_C4_bracket_eq`)
each of which proves a piece equals an explicit polynomial in {a,b}
(with common denominator 2304). The combined identity follows by polynomial
arithmetic.

Connection to T2-B alt-form: from
  sym_E₅ = bqt(a',b) + bqt(a'+b, a') + correction
combined with the deg-5 expansion of `bch(z, a')` (z = bch(a', b)),
one derives `correction = ½·[C₄(a',b), a'] + (deg-5 of T₅) + (deg-5 of T₆)`,
where the deg-5 of T₅, T₆ are computed via Taylor expansion of C₃, C₄
around the static point `(a'+b, a')` in the perturbation `W = z - (a'+b)`. -/

/-! ### T2-F7e Phase C: deg-6 cancellation pure identity

The deg-6 contributions to `sym_bch_cubic - sym_E₃ - sym_E₅` (zero by
palindromic vanishing of even degrees in the 3-factor product) split into
6 pieces that sum to zero algebraically.

Pieces (with `a' := ½a`, `V₂ := ½·[a',b]`, `V₃ := C₃(a',b)`, `V₄ := C₄(a',b)`,
`x := a'+b`):
1. (deg-6 of T₅) = ΔC₃_lin(V₄, x, a') + (1/12)·([V₂,[V₃,a']] + [V₃,[V₂,a']]).
2. (deg-6 of T₆) = ΔC₄_lin(V₃, x, a') + ΔC₄_quad(V₂, x, a').
3. ½·[C₅(a',b), a'] (purely deg-6).
4. C₆(a',b) = bch_sextic_term(a',b) (purely deg-6).
5. C₆(a'+b, a') = bch_sextic_term(a'+b, a') (purely deg-6).
6. (deg-6 of (C₅(z,a') − C₅(a'+b,a'))) = ΔC₅_lin(V₂, x, a') (no clean
   commutator form; explicit 36-monomial polynomial).

CAS-verified at `Lean-Trotter/scripts/verify_t2f7e_deg6_cancellation.py`:
all 6 pieces have common denominator 46080; sum across all monomials = 0.

/-! ### T2-F7e Phase D: Extended hdecomp identity

The algebraic decomposition of `sym_bch_cubic - sym_E₃ - sym_E₅` into 13
sub-pieces (or 4 grouped pieces). Mirrors the cubic template hdecomp from
`norm_symmetric_bch_cubic_sub_poly_le` (`Basic.lean`) but extended with two
more degrees of BCH expansion (C₅, C₆) and the sym_E₅ subtraction.

The 13 sub-pieces are organized into 4 groups:

**Group A (sept-related, 3 sub-pieces)**:
- `R₁_sept` = bch(a',b) − [(a'+b) + ½[a',b] + C₃ + C₄ + C₅ + C₆](a',b)
- `R₂_sept` = bch(z,a') − [(z+a') + ½[z,a'] + C₃ + C₄ + C₅ + C₆](z,a')
- `½·[R₁_sept, a']`

**Group B (C₆ extras, 2 sub-pieces)**:
- `½·[C₆(a',b), a']`
- `C₆(z,a') − C₆(a'+b, a')`

**Group C (Phase B deg-5 cancellation group, 4 sub-pieces; sums to 0 mod
deg-7+ residual)**:
- `T₅` = C₃(z,a') − C₃(a'+b,a') + (1/96)·[b, [a, [a, b]]]  (cubic template)
- `T₆` = C₄(z,a') − C₄(a'+b, a')
- `½·[C₄(a',b), a']`
- `−correction` = `−symmetric_bch_quintic_correction_poly`

**Group D (Phase C deg-6 cancellation group, 4 sub-pieces; sums to 0 mod
deg-7+ residual)**:
- `½·[C₅(a',b), a']`
- `C₆(a',b)`
- `C₆(a'+b, a')`
- `C₅(z,a') − C₅(a'+b, a')`

The proof extends the cubic template's hdecomp by:
1. Substituting the sym_E₃ alt-form (already used in cubic template).
2. Substituting the sym_E₅ alt-form (`symmetric_bch_quintic_poly_alt_form`).
3. Using septic R-definitions instead of quintic R-definitions.
4. Using the `symmetric_bch_quartic_identity` for deg-4 cancellation
   (already used in cubic template).

## Quintic Taylor bridge for the 3-factor symmetric BCH (B1.c)

`norm_symmetric_bch_quintic_sub_poly_le` asserts that after subtracting both
the cubic polynomial `symmetric_bch_cubic_poly` and the quintic polynomial
`symmetric_bch_quintic_poly`, the residual of `symmetric_bch_cubic` decays
as `O(s⁷)`. By palindromic symmetry of `log(exp(a/2)·exp(b)·exp(a/2))`,
every even-degree Taylor coefficient vanishes — so degrees 2, 4, 6 are all
zero, and the first non-zero residual sits at degree 7.

CAS verification at
`Lean-Trotter/scripts/verify_strangblock_degree7.py` confirms this:
degree-7 has 126 non-zero 7-letter words (over `{a, b}`), while degrees
2, 4, 6 all vanish identically. The `s⁷` bound with constant `10⁹`
dominates the series tail for `s < 1/4`.

### Proof status

**Currently accepted from a scoped Tier-2 axiom**
(`symmetric_bch_quintic_sub_poly_axiom`), analogous to Lean-Trotter's
Tier-2 fallback for the τ⁵-identification axiom. The full Lean proof
requires substantial new infrastructure:

* **Tier 1** (~1–2 days): add `bch_quintic_term a b` and
  `norm_bch_sextic_remainder_le` in `Basic.lean` (analogs of the existing
  `bch_quartic_term` and `norm_bch_quintic_remainder_le`), identifying
  the degree-5 coefficient of `bch(a,b)` and giving an `O(s⁶/(2−exp(s)))`
  tail bound.

* **Tier 2** (~1 week, the hardest): extend the 6-term algebraic
  decomposition of the cubic template
  `norm_symmetric_bch_cubic_sub_poly_le` (`Basic.lean`, ~line 3798) to
  the 8–10-term decomposition of the quintic version. Each extra term
  captures a degree-5 correction that is bounded by commutator algebra
  and the sextic remainder. CAS pipeline at
  `Lean-Trotter/scripts/compute_bch_prefactors.py` (extended to degree 7)
  discovers the decomposition mechanically.

* **Tier 3** (~1 day): triangle-inequality assembly of the 8–10 per-term
  `O(s⁷)` bounds, analogous to the cubic template's `5×10⁶ + 5000 + …`
  constant chain.

The axiom is introduced `private` so only the public
`norm_symmetric_bch_quintic_sub_poly_le` theorem appears in the API.
Downstream consumers — the `strangBlock_log` wrapper in `Palindromic.lean`
(B1.d) and the symbolic 5-factor composition in `Suzuki5Quintic.lean` (B2) —
depend only on the theorem, not on the underlying axiom.

/-! ### T2-F7e Phase E (parent discharge): Group C+D sub-axiom

The Phase D `symmetric_bch_quintic_extended_hdecomp` decomposes the residual
`sym_bch_cubic - sym_E₃ - sym_E₅` into 13 sub-pieces in 4 groups (A, B, C, D).
Group A (3 sub-pieces) and Group B (2 sub-pieces) are bounded directly via
Phase A's `norm_bch_inner_septic_remainder_le` /
`norm_bch_outer_septic_remainder_le`, the existing `bch_sextic_term`
Lipschitz bound (`norm_bch_sextic_term_diff_le`), and elementary commutator
estimates (Phase E.1 inline below).

Groups C and D (4+4 = 8 sub-pieces) cancel ALGEBRAICALLY at degrees 5 and 6
via the Phase B identity (`symmetric_bch_quintic_deg5_cancellation_pure_identity`)
and Phase C identity (`symmetric_bch_quintic_deg6_cancellation_pure_identity`)
respectively, leaving a deg-7+ residual. The bound on this residual is
captured in the **Group C+D sub-axiom** below — a stepping stone awaiting
the explicit Phase E.2 discharge (CLAUDE.md).

This sub-axiom is strictly weaker than the original parent axiom: it bounds
ONLY the combined Group C+D contribution (8 of 13 sub-pieces), not the full
residual. Phase A handles Group A; Phase E.1 inline handles Group B; this
sub-axiom handles Groups C+D. -/

/-! **Phase E.2 stepping-stone REPLACED** — the previous `private axiom
symmetric_bch_quintic_group_CD_axiom` (10⁸·s⁷ on 8 Group C+D pieces) has
been REPLACED with the proved theorem `symmetric_bch_quintic_group_CD_le`
(below), which derives the 10⁸·s⁷ bound from:
- `norm_R_T5_sept_le` (proved, ≤ 7·10⁶·s⁷)
- `norm_R_T6_sept_le` (proved, ≤ 10⁶·s⁷)
- `symmetric_bch_quintic_C5_diff_residual_axiom` (focused axiom, ≤ 5·10⁶·s⁷)

The remaining `C5_diff_residual` axiom is much smaller in scope (1 piece
instead of 8, 5·10⁶·s⁷ vs 10⁸·s⁷ constant, and isolates only the C₅
linearization residual). The constant 5·10⁶ is tightly tracking the
realistic Lipschitz piece bound (M⁴·‖WRest6‖ ≈ 1.9·10⁶·s⁷ where
M ≤ 4.22·s, ‖WRest6‖ ≤ 6000·s³ — the latter dominated by Phase A's
1.5·10⁶·s⁷ inner septic remainder bound). -/

/-! ### Group C+D 3-residual algebraic identity (Phase E.2 step 1)

The Phase E.2 discharge proceeds in two stages:
1. **Algebraic identity**: rewrite `Group C + Group D` as a sum of 3 explicit
   deg-7+ residuals using the Phase B and Phase C cancellation identities.
2. **Analytic bounds**: bound each residual by `K·s⁷` via the Lipschitz
   infrastructure (`norm_bch_*_term_diff_le`).

This section completes step 1. The residuals are:
- `R_T5_sept` = T₅ - ΔC₃_lin(V₃) - ΔC₃_quad(V₂) - T5_d6_op
- `R_T6_sept` = T₆ - ΔC₄_lin(V₂) - T6_d6_op
- `C5_diff_residual` = (C₅(z,a') - C₅(a'+b,a')) - ΔC₅_lin

The algebraic identity follows from:
- Phase B: ΔC₃_lin(V₃) + ΔC₃_quad(V₂) + ΔC₄_lin(V₂) + ½·[C₄(a',b),a'] = correction
- Phase C: T5_d6_op + T6_d6_op + ½·[C₅(a',b),a'] + C₆(a',b) + C₆(a'+b,a') + ΔC₅_lin = 0

Adding `(½·[C₄,a'] - correction) = -(ΔC₃_lin(V₃) + ΔC₃_quad(V₂) + ΔC₄_lin(V₂))`
and `(½·[C₅,a'] + C₆(a',b) + C₆(a'+b,a')) = -(T5_d6_op + T6_d6_op + ΔC₅_lin)`
to the C₅-diff piece gives the 3-residual rearrangement.

/-! ### T2-F7e Phase E.2 step 2: R_T5_sept algebraic decomposition

The first residual `R_T5_sept = T₅ - ΔC₃_lin(V₃) - ΔC₃_quad(V₂) - T5_d6_op`
(from `group_CD_eq_three_residuals` above) decomposes structurally as a sum
of L-form (linear-in-W) and Q-form (quadratic-in-W) operator pieces:

```
R_T5_sept = (1/12) · L_C3(a'+b, WHigh, a') + (1/12) · Q_residual
```

where:
- `WHigh := V₅ + V₆ + R₁_sept` (deg-5+ part of W after V₂, V₃, V₄ extracted)
- `WMid := V₄ + V₅ + V₆ + R₁_sept`
- `WRestSept := V₃ + V₄ + V₅ + V₆ + R₁_sept`
- `Q_residual := Q(V₂, WMid) + Q(WMid, V₂) + Q(WRestSept, WRestSept)`
  (the deg-7+ cross terms in the bilinear expansion of Q_C3(W, a'))

The L_C3 and Q_C3 templates match the cubic template's `L_W` and `Q_W` shapes
(see `Basic.lean`'s `norm_symmetric_bch_cubic_sub_poly_le`); the bilinear
extension is via `bch_cubic_term_LQ_decomp` (`Basic.lean`).

The proof uses:
- `bch_cubic_term_LQ_decomp` to split bch_cubic_term(z, a') - bch_cubic_term((a'+b), a')
  into L+Q form with W = z - (a'+b) = V₂ + V₃ + V₄ + V₅ + V₆ + R₁_sept (by
  R₁_sept's definition).
- `match_scalars <;> ring` after distributing smul/mul/add and unfolding V₂, x,
  a', WHigh, WMid, WRestSept (keeping V₃, V₄, V₅, V₆, R₁_sept atomic).

The cancellation `(12)⁻¹·L_V₂ + (96)⁻¹·(b·DC_a - DC_a·b) = 0` (cubic identity)
fires automatically via the polynomial reduction. -/

/-! ### T2-F7e Phase E.2 step 3: R_T6_sept algebraic decomposition

The second residual `R_T6_sept = T₆ - ΔC₄_lin(V₂) - T6_d6_op`
(from `group_CD_eq_three_residuals` above) decomposes structurally as a sum
of L-form (linear-in-W) and Q-form (quadratic-in-W) operator pieces:

```
R_T6_sept = (1/24) · L_C4(a'+b, WHigh4, a') + (1/24) · Q_residual4
```

where:
- `WHigh4 := V₄ + V₅ + V₆ + R₁_sept` (deg-4+ part of W after V₂, V₃ extracted)
- `WRest6 := V₃ + V₄ + V₅ + V₆ + R₁_sept` (deg-3+ part of W after V₂ extracted)
- `Q_residual4 := Q_C4(WRest6, a') + Q_bilin(V₂, WRest6, a')`
  collects the deg-7+ cross terms from the bilinear expansion of Q_C4(W, a')
  with W = V₂+WRest6 (since Q_C4(V₂+WRest6, a') = Q_C4(V₂, a') + Q_C4(WRest6, a')
  + Q_bilin(V₂, WRest6, a'); the Q_C4(V₂, a') diagonal piece is the deg-6
  ΔC₄_quad(V₂) term subtracted into T6_d6_op).

The L_C4 and Q_C4 templates match `bch_quartic_term_LQ_decomp` (`Basic.lean`).
The proof uses LQ_decomp at x = a'+b, W = V₂+V₃+V₄+V₅+V₆+R₁_sept (= z - (a'+b)
by R₁_sept's def), then `match_scalars <;> ring` closes the polynomial identity.

The cancellation of the deg-5 leading op ΔC₄_lin(V₂) and the deg-6 leading
ops ΔC₄_lin(V₃) + ΔC₄_quad(V₂) fires automatically via the polynomial reduction. -/

/-! ### T2-F7e Phase E.2 step 4: norm bound on C5_diff_residual

The third residual `C5_diff_residual = (C₅(z,a') - C₅(a'+b,a')) - ΔC₅_lin_explicit`
captures the deg-7+ remainder of the C₅ Taylor expansion in V₂ after subtracting
the explicit deg-6 (linear-in-V₂) leading polynomial.

**Discharge status (axiom)**: The bound `‖C5_diff_residual‖ ≤ 10⁵·s⁷` is asserted
as a focused private axiom. The full discharge requires either:
- An algebraic identity expressing C5_diff_residual as deg-7+ structured pieces
  (analog of `bch_cubic_term_LQ_decomp`/`bch_quartic_term_LQ_decomp` extended to
  C₅, with quadratic-in-V₂ residual bounded directly), or
- An L+Q+higher decomposition of C₅ in its first argument (~76+ linear-in-V₂
  monomials × 30 base monomials, so ~500+ lines of polynomial identity work).

This axiom is a **stepping stone** — significantly more focused than the
parent T2-F7e axiom or the previous Group C+D axiom (10⁸·s⁷, 8 pieces). It
isolates the linearization residual of one explicit term to a smaller bound
(10⁵·s⁷, 1 piece). -/
