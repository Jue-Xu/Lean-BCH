# BCH/SymmetricQuintic — τ⁵ coefficient of the 3-factor symmetric BCH

Provides the degree-5 polynomial form `symmetric_bch_quintic_poly a b` for
the τ⁵ Taylor coefficient of `log(exp(a/2)·exp(b)·exp(a/2))`, plus its
`c⁵` homogeneity.

This mirrors the existing `symmetric_bch_cubic_poly` in `Basic.lean` and
is the Tier-1 infrastructure piece (definition + homogeneity) for
discharging Lean-BCH's `suzuki5_R5_identification_axiom`.

## Status (Option 1 scope, partial)

**Done this session:**
- `symmetric_bch_quintic_poly a b` — 30-term explicit polynomial form,
  CAS-derived from `Lean-Trotter/scripts/compute_bch_prefactors.py`.
  Rational coefficients with common denominator 5760 (integer
  numerators in `{7, ±7, 42, 72, 12, 32, ±28, ±48, ±8, 192}`).
- `symmetric_bch_quintic_poly_smul` — `c⁵` scaling homogeneity.
  Provable by `simp` on the 5-fold-smul-mul helper.

**Deferred to a follow-up session:**
- `norm_symmetric_bch_quintic_poly_le` — `‖E₅(a, b)‖ ≤ (‖a‖+‖b‖)⁵`.
  Straightforward in principle (30-way triangle inequality + word
  norm ≤ s⁵ + Σ |coef|/5760 = 1216/5760 < 1), but the 29-step
  `norm_add_le` chain is verbose (~50 lines). Not blocking downstream
  development — the definition is fully specified and downstream
  proofs can use pointwise per-term bounds until the global bound lands.
- Full Taylor expansion theorem

      ∃ δ > 0, ∃ K ≥ 0, ∀ τ, ‖τ‖ < δ →
        ‖symmetric_bch(c·τ·a, c·τ·b) − (c·τ)•(a+b)
           − (c·τ)³•symmetric_bch_cubic_poly a b
           − (c·τ)⁵•symmetric_bch_quintic_poly a b‖ ≤ K·‖c·τ‖⁷·(‖a‖+‖b‖)⁷

  requires a degree-5+ symbolic BCH expansion machinery (extend H1/H2's
  cubic/quartic to quintic). This is the B1.c piece of the session-9+
  roadmap for discharging `suzuki5_R5_identification_axiom`.

## The 30-term τ⁵ polynomial

CAS-derived from
`Lean-Trotter/scripts/compute_bch_prefactors.py::strang_block_series`
at degree 5. Each of the 30 non-zero 5-letter words `x₁x₂x₃x₄x₅` with
`xᵢ ∈ {a, b}` has a rational coefficient with common denominator 5760.

Palindromic symmetry: `coef(w) = coef(reverse(w))` — 12 word/reverse
pairs plus 6 self-palindromic words (AABAA, ABABA, ABBBA, BAAAB,
BABAB, BBABB).

/-- **τ⁵ coefficient of `log(exp(a/2)·exp(b)·exp(a/2))`** — explicit
30-term polynomial form.

The coefficients are rational with LCM 5760; written individually here.
This is the 3-factor Strang block's quintic BCH coefficient, analogous
to `symmetric_bch_cubic_poly` for the cubic coefficient.

For any `c : 𝕂`, `symmetric_bch_quintic_poly(c•a, c•b) = c⁵ •

homogeneous of degree 5 in `(a, b)`.

## Norm bound: `‖E₅(a, b)‖ ≤ (‖a‖ + ‖b‖)⁵`

Proof strategy: each 5-letter word has norm ≤ `s⁵` where
`s = ‖a‖ + ‖b‖`; the sum of `|coef|·5760` over the 30 terms is
`1216 ≤ 5760`, giving total `‖E₅‖ ≤ (1216/5760)·s⁵ ≤ s⁵`.

/-- **Norm bound for `symmetric_bch_quintic_poly`**:
`‖E₅(a, b)‖ ≤ (‖a‖ + ‖b‖)⁵`.

Proof: each of the 30 terms is bounded by `|coef|·s⁵` via
`norm_scaled_word_le`; the 30 integer numerators `|k|` sum to 1216
(< 5760), so the triangle-inequality chain yields the `s⁵` bound.

## Vanishing on `(α•V, β•V)` (B2.2.a)

`symmetric_bch_quintic_poly` evaluated at scalar multiples of a single element
`V : 𝔸` is identically zero:

  `E₅(α•V, β•V) = 0`  for any  `α, β : 𝕂, V : 𝔸`.

This is a structural property: each 5-letter word `x₁x₂x₃x₄x₅` (with each
`xᵢ ∈ {α•V, β•V}`) evaluates to `(α^k · β^(5−k)) • V⁵` where `k` is the number
of `α`-slots. Summing the 30 word coefficients per `k`-group gives identically
zero polynomials in `(α, β)`:

* `k = 4` (5 words `xxxxy` with one `b`):  `7 − 28 + 42 − 28 + 7 = 0`
* `k = 3` (10 words):  `−28 + 72 + 12 − 48 − 48 + 12 + 32 − 48 + 72 − 28 = 0`
* `k = 2` (10 words):  `32 − 48 − 48 + 32 − 48 + 192 − 48 − 48 − 48 + 32 = 0`
* `k = 1` (5 words `xyyyy` with one `a`):  `−8 + 32 − 48 + 32 − 8 = 0`
* `k = 0, 5`:  no terms in the polynomial (no `aaaaa` or `bbbbb` words).

This is the **foundation lemma for B2.2**: when expanding
`sym_quintic_poly(4X, Y)` with `X = (pτ)•V + R_X` and `Y = ((1−4p)τ)•V + R_Y`,
the leading "all-V-linear" τ⁵ contribution vanishes, leaving only "≥1
residual" cross-terms which sit at `O(τ⁷)` (since each residual is `O(τ³)`).

**Why this matters**: in the τ⁵ identification of `suzuki5_R5`, the
`sym_quintic_poly(4X, Y)` contribution turns out to be `O(τ⁷)` — i.e., it
doesn't contribute at τ⁵ — so the entire τ⁵ residue comes from
`sym_cubic_poly(4X, Y)` plus the per-block quintic `(4p⁵+(1−4p)⁵)·E₅_sym`. -/

/-! ### B2.2.c — Lipschitz bound on (α•V + δa, β•V + δb) inputs

When the inputs are perturbations `(α•V + δa, β•V + δb)` of scalar multiples,
the symmetric quintic polynomial is bounded by `2·N⁴·(‖δa‖+‖δb‖)` rather than
the trivial `(‖α•V+δa‖+‖β•V+δb‖)⁵`. The structural vanishing on scalar•V inputs
(B2.2.a) is the source of the `δ`-linear factor; combined with the 5-letter
Lipschitz bound (`word_5_diff_le`), this gives a "linear in residual" bound.

For the Suzuki τ⁵ identification, this means `‖sym_quintic_poly(4X, Y)‖ = O(τ⁷)`
when `X, Y` have linear part `O(τ)` plus residual `O(τ³)`. -/

/-- **B2.2.c**: Lipschitz bound for `symmetric_bch_quintic_poly` on inputs of the
form `(α • V + δa, β • V + δb)`.

Combined with B2.2.a's vanishing on scalar•V inputs, the bound is
`O(N⁴ · (‖δa‖+‖δb‖))` rather than the trivial `(‖α•V+δa‖+‖β•V+δb‖)⁵`.

**Why this matters**: in the τ⁵ identification of `suzuki5_R5`, the inputs to
`symmetric_bch_quintic_poly` are `4X` and `Y` where `X = pτ•A + (residual O(τ³))`.
Setting `α = 4·p·τ`, `V = A`, and treating the residuals as `δa, δb = O(τ³)`,
the bound becomes `O(N⁴ · τ³)` where `N = O(τ)`, i.e., `O(τ⁷)` — gaining 2 orders
of `τ` over the trivial bound. The structural vanishing on `V`-only inputs is the
source of the extra factor of `τ²`.

Proof: B2.2.a gives `sym_quintic_poly(α•V, β•V) = 0`, so
`sym_quintic_poly(α•V+δa, β•V+δb) = sym_quintic_poly(α•V+δa, β•V+δb) - sym_quintic_poly(α•V, β•V)`.
The diff regroups into 30 paired smul-diff terms `cᵢ•(full_word - lin_word)`, each
bounded by `|cᵢ|/5760 · 5·(N⁴·D)` via `word_5_diff_le`. Summing gives `1216·5/5760·N⁴·D

## Alt-form decomposition of `symmetric_bch_quintic_poly`

CAS-derived (`Lean-Trotter/scripts/discover_quintic_alt_form.py`):

    sym_E₅(a, b) = bch_quintic_term(½a, b)
                 + bch_quintic_term(½a + b, ½a)
                 + symmetric_bch_quintic_correction_poly(a, b)

The correction polynomial is a 25-term degree-5 polynomial in `{a, b}` with
common denominator `11520` and integer numerators in
`{±15, ±20, ±30, ±40, ±50, ±60, ±90, ±110, ±160}`. It captures the three
remaining contributions:
- `½·[bch_quartic_term(½a, b), ½a]` (degree-5 from ½[z, ½a])
- `(C₃(z, ½a) − C₃(½a+b, ½a))_d5` (linear-in-z_d3 + bilinear-in-z_d2)
- `(C₄(z, ½a) − C₄(½a+b, ½a))_d5` (linear-in-z_d3 + linear-in-z_d2)

This is the analog of `symmetric_bch_cubic_poly_alt_form` (Basic.lean) at
one degree higher, and is the key infrastructure for discharging the B1.c
Tier-2 axiom `symmetric_bch_quintic_sub_poly_axiom`.

associativity normalization differences). Approach needs goal-state

## Quintic Taylor bridge for the 3-factor symmetric BCH (B1.c)

`norm_symmetric_bch_quintic_sub_poly_le` asserts that after subtracting both
the cubic polynomial `symmetric_bch_cubic_poly` and the quintic polynomial
`symmetric_bch_quintic_poly`, the residual of `symmetric_bch_cubic` decays
as `O(s⁷)`. By palindromic symmetry of `log(exp(a/2)·exp(b)·exp(a/2))`,
every even-degree Taylor coefficient vanishes — so degrees 2, 4, 6 are all
zero, and the first non-zero residual sits at degree 7.

CAS verification at
`Lean-Trotter/scripts/verify_strangblock_degree7.py` confirms this:
degree-7 has 126 non-zero 7-letter words (over `{a, b}`), while degrees
2, 4, 6 all vanish identically. The `s⁷` bound with constant `10⁹`
dominates the series tail for `s < 1/4`.

### Proof status

**Currently accepted from a scoped Tier-2 axiom**
(`symmetric_bch_quintic_sub_poly_axiom`), analogous to Lean-Trotter's
Tier-2 fallback for the τ⁵-identification axiom. The full Lean proof
requires substantial new infrastructure:

* **Tier 1** (~1–2 days): add `bch_quintic_term a b` and
  `norm_bch_sextic_remainder_le` in `Basic.lean` (analogs of the existing
  `bch_quartic_term` and `norm_bch_quintic_remainder_le`), identifying
  the degree-5 coefficient of `bch(a,b)` and giving an `O(s⁶/(2−exp(s)))`
  tail bound.

* **Tier 2** (~1 week, the hardest): extend the 6-term algebraic
  decomposition of the cubic template
  `norm_symmetric_bch_cubic_sub_poly_le` (`Basic.lean`, ~line 3798) to
  the 8–10-term decomposition of the quintic version. Each extra term
  captures a degree-5 correction that is bounded by commutator algebra
  and the sextic remainder. CAS pipeline at
  `Lean-Trotter/scripts/compute_bch_prefactors.py` (extended to degree 7)
  discovers the decomposition mechanically.

* **Tier 3** (~1 day): triangle-inequality assembly of the 8–10 per-term
  `O(s⁷)` bounds, analogous to the cubic template's `5×10⁶ + 5000 + …`
  constant chain.

The axiom is introduced `private` so only the public
`norm_symmetric_bch_quintic_sub_poly_le` theorem appears in the API.
Downstream consumers — the `strangBlock_log` wrapper in `Palindromic.lean`
(B1.d) and the symbolic 5-factor composition in `Suzuki5Quintic.lean` (B2) —
depend only on the theorem, not on the underlying axiom.

/-- **[Tier-2 axiom, pending]** — the quintic Taylor bridge for the 3-factor
symmetric BCH.

Asserts that after subtracting both the cubic polynomial
`symmetric_bch_cubic_poly` (line-3 Taylor coefficient) and the quintic
polynomial `symmetric_bch_quintic_poly` (line-5 Taylor coefficient, defined
above), the residual of `symmetric_bch_cubic a b` is `O(s⁷)`.

By palindromic symmetry of `log(exp(a/2)·exp(b)·exp(a/2))`, degrees 2, 4,
and 6 vanish identically (CAS-verified at
`Lean-Trotter/scripts/verify_strangblock_degree7.py`), so the first
non-zero residual is at degree 7.

The constant `10⁹` is a loose margin — degree 7 has 126 non-zero words in
`{a,b}`, and the geometric tail for `s < 1/4` contributes a small further
factor. A tighter version with `K·s⁷/(2−exp(s))` (analog of
`norm_bch_sextic_remainder_le`) would be possible, but the simpler `K·s⁷`
form suffices for B1.d and B2 downstream uses.

Introduced `private` so only the public derived
`norm_symmetric_bch_quintic_sub_poly_le` theorem appears in the API. -/

/-- **Quintic Taylor bridge for the 3-factor symmetric BCH**:

    ‖symmetric_bch_cubic(a,b) − symmetric_bch_cubic_poly(a,b)
        − symmetric_bch_quintic_poly(a,b)‖ ≤ 10⁹ · (‖a‖+‖b‖)⁷

for `‖a‖+‖b‖ < 1/4`. Extends `norm_symmetric_bch_cubic_sub_poly_le`
(`Basic.lean`) by one degree higher, factoring out the τ⁵ coefficient
along with the τ³ coefficient.

**Status**: Currently derived from the scoped Tier-2 axiom
`symmetric_bch_quintic_sub_poly_axiom`. The public signature is stable so
downstream work (B1.d's `strangBlock_log` wrapper, B2's symbolic 5-factor
composition, Lean-Trotter's `bch_w4Deriv_quintic_level2`) depends only on
this theorem, not on the underlying axiom. Removing the axiom requires
the Tier 1/2/3 work described in the section header above. -/
